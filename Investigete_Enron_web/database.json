to august record peak electricity demand driven by a swel tering heat wave severely tested the reliability of the competitive pjm mar ket the pjm market passed its stress test with little public notice or cre dit as usual only ships that sink or planes that crash draw headlines with airconditioners battling near degree temperatures consumers set three new peak usage records on august and with demand hitting megawatts mw and mw respectively these new recor ds smashed the old peak of approximately mw set in a and contr ibuted to unhealthy air in large parts of the midatlantic region they als o highlight the need to enact better demand response programs and energy ef ficiency policies in order to reduce the strain placed on power supplies as well as to protect the environment and public health the ability of the pjm competitive market to meet record demands and keep c onsumers cool sharply contrast with californias inability to keep the ligh ts on even in periods of lowseasonal usage from late through march of this year speaking of pjms impressive reliability performance pjm presi dent phil harris concluded this weeks accomplishment is testimony to how effective markets and efficient operations work in harmony to reliably ser ve the electric customer but keeping the lights on should never be taken for granted prior to restructuring in january rolling blackouts occurred through out the pjm power pool when demand for about mw couldnt be met the se blackouts occurred primarily because huge numbers of plants which were rate based and operated by fully regulated monopolies or nonutility genera tors with purpa contracts experienced mechanical and fuel problems at the same time this painful experience ensured that policymakers made reliability a top pr iority and a major topic of discussion when enacting the states electricit y competition and customer choice act in asking questions like would a competitive market attract sufficient investment to build necessary plan ts would existing plants perform better or worse and experience less or mo re outages could consumers be paid market prices to reduce demand at peak usage times in order to increase incentives for energy conservation the last five years and meeting record peaks both in and answer t hose questions and prove the reliability of the competitive pjm market the market is producing lots of new generation most of it new natural gas pl ants and some wind power and all of it much cleaner than the coal and nucl ear plants which dominated the generation market more than years ago pl ants in pjm have never operated better and have reduced their forced outage rate by about percent since additionally a few customers partici pated in pjms emerging demand response programs during the august hea t wave but many more customers would reduce usage in peak periods in return for ma rketbased compensation if they only had the ability though demand respons e has its nose under the generation tent it still hasnt reached most penn sylvanians neither pennsylvania nor any other state has taken policy steps to ensure that a necessary infrastructure of timeofuse meters and applia nce control devices is deployed throughout every home and business a failu re which amounts to regulatory malpractice until the pennsylvania public u tility commission requires the deployment of these available technologies o ver a reasonable period prices for electricity will remain higher than the y need be pollution will be worse than it should be and reliability will be less than it could be keeping the lights on during the recent heat wave pjm encouraged general restraint in usage imp lemented its demand response programs and reduced voltage by percent to percent for brief periods undetectable to most customers beyond not fa iling the system performed so well in large part because of the competitiv e market not despite it several factors worked to maintain system reliabi lity including better power plant performance new generation imports sk illful management of the operation of the transmission system and demand re sponse improved generation plant operation of all these factors dramatically bet ter plant performance is the single biggest key to competitive pjms impre ssive reliability performance during the last five years generating plants are operating much more reliably now than during the monopoly era in the forced outage rate at pjm generation plants was percent meaning that a plant scheduled to be available was in fact unavailable for operati onal reasons percent of the time the forced outage rate of generating facilities in pjm declined to percent in percent in percent in and to percent in in when you really nee ded a generator there was a in chance that the unit wouldnt be availa ble but in the odds that a generator would be forced out of service at any particular time had fallen to in under price regulation generators for the most part got paid even if their plants were unavailable to generate electricity because of operational or maintenance problems with the move to marketbased prices generators have a builtin incentive to be there especially when demand and prices are hi gh even the pjm capacity payment still a relic of ratebased generation has moved from a payment simply because a plant was physically built to one based upon the generating units historical availability to provide gen eration when needed the decline in unforced outage rates is a testament to the change in how generators get paid at the percent average for ced outage rate about mw would have been unavailable at the p ercent average forced outage rate for more than mw would have b een unavailable every generation owner deserves credit for this superb per formance new generation another reason the lights are staying on despite record pea ks is the new generation built to serve the midatlantic market the develo pment of competitive power plants continues to accelerate in pjm with over mw scheduled to come online in and even more for in con trast demand in is expected to grow by less than mw the midatlantic experience documents that new generation can be supplied i n a competitive market the market is delivering plenty of new generation t hat is dramatically cleaner and more efficient than that built during the m onopoly era transparent prices in a competitive efficient market are enco uraging investors to build unlike the previous generations of power plants no captive monopoly consumer had to guarantee any investor in a new gener ation plant a single penny return of the investment or a single penny retur n on the investment unlike many of the previous generation of power plants these new plants use mostly natural gas instead of coal or nuclear fuel cost billions less to build can be planned and built more quickly and don t pollute nearly as much and these plants will never receive a penny in s tranded costs imports the pjm transparent competitive market sends price signals to gene rators in its territory to encourage them to build new supply and to keep their plants in service and available especially at peak demand as well as to national electricity markets especially in the midwest and virginia peak demand and relatively high peak prices in pjm enabled pjm to benefit from surplus supplies in adjacent regions and import significant amounts o f electricity often over mw of net imports when it was needed mos t pjm operations properly managing the electric grid isnt an easy task on a typical day but during a heat wave its particularly challenging in augu st pjm showed exceptional restraint and skill in managing a potential cris is without overreacting relying on the market and voluntary reductions whi le avoiding the more intrusive controls at their disposal the percent to percent reduced voltage levels for a few hours were the only nonvolunta ry reductions measures imperceptible to most consumers demand response pjm called upon industrial customers to curtail usage thro ugh traditional interruptible service in which large customers receive a di scounted rate in exchange for having service interrupted when supply is lim ited and requested that all customers especially large industrial custome rs voluntarily limit consumption and turn on onsite generation pjm also successfully utilized several new market based curtailment programs and e stimates that approximately mw of peak load was avoided through incent ive programs and implementation of its pilot demandside response program there was an increase of nearly mw of active load management whi ch accounted for a good portion of the demand response programs instituted by pjm unlike the previous year alm was not excluded from participating i n the pjm demand response programs additionally about of nonalm re sources have enrolled in pjms emergency and economic programs while this represents a humble start the effects during the peak hours can still be s ignificant prices peak demand produces peak prices in a competitive market but pjm m arket prices remained well under control because new development imports a nd plants in service provided adequate supply and because pjm has a market rule limiting bids to per mwh average peak hour prices am to pm at the pjm western hub were about mwh in many hours prices remained less than mwh while during a few hours prices were constrain ed by the rate cap these peak prices are quite moderate compared to the extreme volatility that was seen in the midwest in with prices r ising to several thousand dollars per mwh or the recent price spikes in ca lifornia indeed oneyear forward contract prices within pjm have collapsed since ju ne and the august heat wave hasnt reversed the sharp declines an allhou rs pjm contract now can be had for about per mwh june july a nd august contracts have fallen percent from summer prices these forward prices are now reflecting the pjm spot market prices that fel l in compared to and have hovered around per mwh for the last months both the pjm spot price and the forward contract price are up to percent less than what most pennsylvania customers paid their mono polies for generation in if they were paying only competitive prices instead of competitive prices plus stranded costs primarily for nuclear plants every pennsylvania customer would have a huge rate cut and the award goes to congratulations to pjm and its staff for operating the pjm market reliably and competitively in the most difficult challenging circumstances it has f aced so far their service to the public is unfortunately not widely recogn ized and is taken for granted thanks as well to the plant operators who ha ve never operated their plants better and to those fortunate consumers who had the ability to participate in demand response programs and reduced thei r usage for compensation public safety economic

person who had his briefcase stolen while on a business trip he lost everything inside the briefcase was his passport wallet house keys car keys and cash i guess no one told him not to keep everything in one place he immediately went back to his hotel room and dialed the numbers listed below the only thing the thieves got was a free tank of gas they literally filled their tank within blocks of the hotel but that is all they got after calling the numbers below the next call was to the local police department a call was then made to his hometown department of motor vehicles and social security office he then called his wife requesting she get all the locks changed on the house and cars immediately this is excellent advice another good piece of advise is to place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine do both sides of each license credit card etc you will know what you had in your wallet along with the account numbers and the phone numbers to call in case you need to cancel keep the copy in a safe place we have all heard horror stories about fraud that is committed using someone elses name address social security number credit etc here is some critical information to limit the damage in case this happens to you as everyone always advises cancel your credit cards immediately but the key is having the toll free phone numbers and your credit card numbers handy so you will know whom to call keep these where you can find them easily file a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where the theft occurred this proves to credit providers you were diligent it is also the first step toward an investigation but heres what is perhaps most important call the three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and social security number the alert means any company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen they have to contact you by phone at a number you provide to authorize any new credit the numbers are equifax experian trans union also make a call to social security administration i hope you never need this information if you do i hope you find it helpful feel free to share this email with

with fuelcells is largely defined before we make a state filing we are going to emphasize to fce that both sides need to devote their technical resources to this goal one of our priorities is to bring the technical portions of the purchase order up to the level necessary to finalize an order i need the tony leo list today so i can show fuelcells all the information that they owe us before this meeting we have redrafted the purchase order however the po needs refinement to reflect the resolution of the outstanding business terms and to make certain that the technical information and procedures are clearly defined given the proposed payment mechanics and fces lack of mature documents we are concerned that fce will try to get by with loose technical language to avoid acceptance and ultimately payment issues also we are concerned that once we make our state filing that our negotiating leverage with fce will go down one of our major focuses jobs between now and is to make certain that the technical sections of the po are properly defined with regard to the bop cost estimates i would like to get the revised estimates no later than tomorrow our current plan is to make a state

information provided in the filing a draft of the filing is to be sent to crra by given this approach it is less important that we go to the sites next week our focus should be on getting the purchase

has yet to be scheduled the reason for the delay is an issue concerning whether sgss singapore laboratory has the resourcescompetence to carry out the joint analysis steve jones ects choice of chemist is communicating with sgs in order to make this determination although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing jones feels strongly that it will be most costeffective for ect to proceed with a joint analysis only after making this determination i have personally spoken with jones about this and believe he understands that ect is looking for the quickest most costeffective resolution to this dispute with mitsubishi because of the issue with sgs jones has waited until now to send the proposed testing program to technichem mitsubishis choice of surveyorchemist in a previous report i mentioned that the testing program had already been sent to technichem this now turns out not to be the case by today jones should have sent the proposed testing program to technichem in order to get the ball rolling and with the expectation that technichem will have comments that will require time to incorporate if things go well with sgs jones anticipates scheduling a joint analysis about twothree weeks from now jones plan to personally attend the joint survey on our behalf given the complexity of the testing methods even after that testing jones anticipates the possibility of further testing in england using highly specialized equipment to determine whether the apparent filterable dirt buildup was caused by a malfunction of the vessels inert gas system costs surveyorschemists jones advises that to date he and his firm have spent a total of about days at pounds per day for a total of approximately pounds or roughly at the current usdpounds exchange rate of pound jones has subcontracted some of his work to allen goddard now with itscaleb brett who specializes in the type of testing at issue jones estimates that goddard has spent approximately one day on this matter at a daily rate of lbs or jones estimates that from this point until the actual joint survey begins he will spend about two more days and goddard will spend about another onehalf day this totals about pounds or for the actual joint testing jones estimates that he will spend about twelve days straight including transit time goddard would not attend but would be available by telephone if jones had a question twelve days time amounts to pounds or not including aire fare room and board afterwards for the additional testing in england to determine whether the inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt jones estimates another pounds for the cost of the lab he does not know at this point whether he would attend the entire testing procedure which he believes could be completed in about two days if he attended both days this additional testing in england would run to another pounds or other experts sgs and caleb bretts costs to date are being compiled by matt sgs will spend another sgd purchasing the necessary chemicals for the joint testing and bill for another sgd for prejointanalysis development work this comes to a total of sgd or about to prepare for the joint analysis based on the current reported sgdusd exchange rate of sgs estimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis sgd or about captain sawant of pacmarine one of our ship operations experts will be charging us sgd or about for work done to date which should be largely concluded with the finalization of his report captain gregory of noble denton the ship operation expert we would probably use for testifying has been asked to do no work on this matter at this time attorneys david best is out of town on vacation but his office advises that his time and expenses to date amounts to approximately pounds or about this is subject to being adjusted up or down once best gets back in the office and has time to review the bill i imagine that this bill does not include the time incurred by a barrister that best called for advice on the fgh issue neither best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend the joint testing neale gregsons firm watson farley has incurred fees and expense to date of sgd or about matt has not yet seen an itemized bill for this time but feels that while it is high it is not unexpected given the timeintensive nature of this matter matt will be asking gregson whether the time also includes time spent on the fgh matter my and my legal assistants fee and expenses through today amount to approximately this also includes time spent on the fgh matter although pursuant to alans instructions i am no longer spending time on that matter except where necessary to keep janice moore apprised summary of costs in sum no less than approximately has been spent to date and this figure will increase once i get the sgs and caleb brett costs to date and once david best comes back from vacation on september and reviews his bill although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on the fgh matter another will be necessary to get ready for the joint analysis another to perform the joint analysis in singapore and another approximately to perform specialized testing in london after the joint analysis is done if steve jones determines that such further testing is necessary recent sale of thailand cargo you will recall that the bulk of the product from the mv pacific virgo was discharged in to shore tanks in thailand and has not been tendered to fgh given the problems with the product discharged later in the phillipines which was tendered to fgh who rejected it samples from the shore tanks in thailand have recently been tested by sgss laboratory in the us and reportedly found on spec all of the thailand product has recently been sold to caltex singapore for delivery september reportedly for use in caltexs refinery which makes the risk of rejection of that product by caltex very low unfortunately matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a ballpark figure for the sales price of the thailand product until the end of the month given that the price is tied to some market index lacking this it is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the elang crude ect has sustained until then we were previously told that the product discharged in singapore sustained a diminution in market value of about for my own purposes based on nothing more than speculation and given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in thailand i am using the working hypothesis that ects total damages for diminution of market value of all the product discharged from the mv pacific virgo is in the range of again this may later turn out to be very inaccurate expert witness supplemental opinion at my request captain sawant our consulting expert on ship operations was asked whether he believed that ects instructions to the ship regarding tank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination that occurred had such instructions been properly carried out ie if the ship had access to fresh water captain sawant has opined that he does not believe such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of contamination that occurred while we can protect captain sawants opinion from discovery by using him only as a consulting expert it strikes me that mitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue despite this however ect still has some argument that the carriage of goods by sea act puts a nondelegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on mitsubishi"}},

had prevented the completion of collect calls from prison facilities families of inmates complained that worldcom didnt notify them that collect calls would be blocked even though collect call charges were always paid in full under the companys current tariffs worldcom can block collect calls from correctional facilities without notice worldcom places collect call blocks to prevent high toll fraud situations the company identifies end users with unusually high numbers of collect calls and then assesses the end users payment history and whether the end user has verified that the calls are legitimate the department determined that worldcoms procedures are reasonable but found that placing collect call blocks constitutes a form of termination of service the department concluded that

that the consumptionproduction is a net number for a minute period so we do not know what the turbine loads are only what they are netting this leaves two questions what is the turbine consuming during normal operation including standby full power etc and what is the potential financial liability a particular site has for consumed power the first question we cannot answer with the scada data because the scada data is a net number this one will require actual measurement of data to ascertain the second question we cannot answer with the scada data unless the frequency of the measurement coincides with the minute scada periodicity regarding the second question since we will be charged a different rate for consumed power a retail rate versus the rate we are paid for produced power we cannot depend on a net metering solution with an arbitrary frequency taking a look at extremes by way of example if we are netting on a monthly basis then we will never owe anything under a net metering solution this is because in normal operation the turbine always produces more power than it consumes on a monthly basis on the other hand if the frequency is based on a minute periodicity then we will have instances of individual minutes one would be a minute in which we produced power and sold it at the retail rate and the other would be a minute where we consumed power and purchased it at the retail rate this is because the turbine is not producing power during every minute of the month there are an infinite number of permutations because you can set the time interval to an infinite number of values our current value is a net number based on a minute interval if the utility is basing their measurement on a different frequency then we will certainly get a different total for power consumed the other issue is the location of the measurement if the measurement is at the substation then the net number is an aggregate of the wind turbines which dampens the impact of a particular turbine if the measurement is with our scada system at the individual turbine then we maximize the impact if a particular turbine is down for any reason while the remaining turbines are operating therefore to more fully understand the question from mark we also need to know additional points what is the proposed frequency for the metering where is the measurement going to take place as mentioned earlier we can provide the net productionconsumption for each minute interval however i think the only way we can fully address this question is to run a test program based on the answers

journal dow jones company inc this is a rough era for american business icons subject to the vagaries of age product failure competition technology and dotbomb bubbles managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business the latest example is enron whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to dynegy once considered one of the countrys most innovative companies enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest the journalistic accounts of enrons struggles drip with schadenfreude hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage we hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation we agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed high profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms but no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value deregulation and market competition enron envisioned gas and electric power industries in the us where prices are set in an open market of bidding by customers and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit enron was the leader in pioneering this business market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the us and is spreading to europe latin america and asia the winners have been consumers who have paid lower prices and investors who have seen competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient the contrary experience of california the poster child of those who would reregulate the power industry is an example of not enough deregulation innovation and the deintegration of power contracts under the old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity customers were offered a onesizefitsall contract for many customers this system was inflexible and inefficient like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure by the truckload enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer to do this enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent parts starting with price and volume location time etc and offered customers choices on each one again consumers won enrons investors did too because enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors arguably enron is the embodiment of what economist joseph schumpeter called the process of creative destruction but creative destroyers are not necessarily likable pleasant folks which may be part of enrons problem today minimization of transaction costs and frictions enron extended the logic of deintegration to other industries an integrated paper company for instance owns forests mills pulp factories and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller specialized firms enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of customers and suppliers enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the freemarket terms would be better than those of the internal operations the development of freemarket benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy exploiting the optionality in networks in the old regulated environment natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources opening the customer to the benefits of competition and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies enron benefited from controlling switches on the network so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons this policy picked up by others in the industry created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers rigorous risk assessment the strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed and of very strong internal controls enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere particularly with the advent of enron online where enron made new positions valued at over billion each day it became essential to have uptothesecond information on companywide positions prices and ability to deliver the unexpected bad news from enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm but with fears among trading partners about enrons ability to finance its trading activity in a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance it was the erosion in equity rather than trading risk that destroyed the firm a culture of urgency innovation and high expectations enrons corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all the hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic hierarchical formal slow and full of excuses and the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company enron only years ago is even duller and slower enron became bumptious impatient lean fast innovative and demanding it bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses create markets and transfer within the firm success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion and an openoffice design fostered brainstorming the firms organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs this was a lightning rod for the firms detractors and yet it could serve as a model for more hidebound enterprises to emulate enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of american business it created a ruckus in oncequiet corners of the business economy it rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business it thrived on volatility the proposed sale of enron to dynegy risks the loss of a major r establishment especially given dynegys track record as a second mover following enrons lead beyond what is likely to be a difficult and timeconsuming antitrust review dynegys greater challenge will be to find a way to make enrons spirit of innovation its own or so we all should hope because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries messrs bodily and bruner are

the bulk of the funds to the plant want to c ontinue supporting the project but they are being opposed by offshore lend ers who want to withdraw their loans loans of around million of the o ffshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by indian institutions the indian lenders fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pu ll the plug plan to oppose any such move but they have been forced on the backfoot by msebs decision last week to stop buying power from dabhol and terminate its contract with the company under which it agreed to lift the entire output the mseb has complained that dabhol produces costly power while dabhol has blamed mseb for defaulting on payments worth million last month dabho l issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power it h as

new pack for the enron power project is expected to include fi scal sops and financial concessions so as to reduce the tariff on its part the state electricity board will have to commit itself to a

is in favour of ensuring international contracts are respected union power minister suresh prabhu said as investors fears grow over a squabble between us energy giant enron and the maharashtra state electricity board the row was sparked late last year when mseb defaulted on payments of million to dabhol power company per cent owned by houstonbased enron prabhu said it was obvious investors saw some questionmarks over enrons billion power plant which is indias largest private foreign investmen t enron is building the plant but the dispute with the mseb has threaten ed to derail the mw power project we have to address those concerns adequately because the government of india is always in favour of making s ure that international contracts are respected in the process of assuring a ll the foreign investors that there is no need for concern prabhu said signs emerged last week that investors were souring on india global rating agency fitch last thursday revised indias sovereign rating o utlook to negative from stable citing concerns over fiscal policy privati sation and deterioration in the countrys foreign investment climate compe ting agency moodys said on friday it saw slippage in the indian government s reform effort but declined to say whether a ratings change could be exp ected while standard poors said it was worried about the size of the bu dget deficit asked if he felt the enron row had deterred investors prabhu said this is one single issue we must deal with it in the manner in whi ch it is possible in a given situation there is a negotiation going on the central government has a representative on the negotiating committee an d i am sure that the only way in which commercial disputes can be settled i s through negotiations prabhu was referring to a panel set up last month by the maharashtra government to renegotiate the tariffs charged by the mw dabhol power project the mseb which agreed in to buy the plants entire output says the p ower is too costly and has defaulted on million in power payments dabh ol issued a notice last month to cancel its power purchase deal a move man y investors fear could be the first step towards getting out of the project entirely the phase in which we are right now is the phase in which s ome independent power producers have already contracted certain obligations which we will definitely like to uphold which should be honoured prabhu added because in india contracts are very important sanctity of contrac ts should be kept the times of india tuesday june prabhu says power reforms enter new phase indias reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase wi th plans afoot to free up private supply overhaul debtridden state utilit ies and recraft tariffs power minister suresh prabhu told reuters with in vestors fears fanned by a squabble between us energy giant enron corp an d a local utility prabhu said in an interview late on sunday that india is standing behind international contracts sanctity of contracts has to be kept prabhu said the row began late last year when the utility in maharashtra defaulted on p ayments of million to dabhol power company percent owned by enron the mw power project is indias largest foreign investment at b illion prabhu has vowed to take indian reforms in a new direction absolu tely he said in reply to a question whether indias reforms have entered a different phase the power ministry will now also focus on power distribu tion he added besides its early preoccupation with generation needs in india unfortunately for the last yearsreforms policy was skewed in fa vour of generation he said we never really realised that distribution i s the more important part of the process prabhu added we have now decid ed we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the en d of distribution enough investment is made a chartered accountant prabhu hails from the verdant regions of indias we stern coastal strand and chaired a cooperative bank that was one of the c ountrys largest in terms of deposits before his foray into politics an errant lock of hair straying across his forehead prabhu eschews the indian politicians traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered government and whom local media call technocrats prabhu said india has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers lifti ng curbs that have hobbled the countrys decadeold reform effort he said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask indias states to permit thirdparty sales of power which analysts have called a s tumblingblock for foreign investment they cannot force a generator to se ll power only to the sebs and thats a major change we are trying to make prabhu said referring to the states sebs or state electricity boards ar e owned by the state governments and supply power to most of india india estimates that mw of fresh capacity will have to be installed over the next years to meet its power needs most of the billion in fund s that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment but indias spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wa ry bureaucratic procedures legal delays and political wrangling have held up reform moves last week global rating agency fitch revised indias sovereign rating outlo ok to negative from stable citing fiscal concerns the slow pace of privat isation and deterioration in the countrys foreign investment climate comp eting agency moodys sees signs of slippage in the reforms and standard poors has expressed worries over indias budget deficit prabhu said he wa nts to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting po licies cutting transmission and distribution losses to percent and tac kling crushing debt thus helping to lure foreign investment into the secto r the poor financial health of the utilities expected to run up combined losses of about billion in the fiscal year has proved a hurdle in efforts to draw private investment prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure seb finances l ooking at technical commercial and tariff issues is expected to report within a few weeks for the first time we will be preparing commercial dat a which is internationally accepted we will be preparing technical data wh ich is internationally appreciable and thirdly well be creating an infor mation base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states he said the utilities transmission and distribution losses run to up to percent of the electricity they generate compared to a figure of about eight percent internationally he said prabhu wants to trim this to about percent within two or three years i n the case of india i am willing to accept a figure of percent to pe rcent because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but othe r steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern re gion with the rest of india efforts to boost plant load factors through mo dernisation of equipment and to persuade people to use energy more efficie ntly prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves thro ugh a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power cheap o r even free as many did in the past the economic times tuesday june scrap the ppa with dabhol dr r k pachauri it is unfortunate that the dabhol project is in such a terrible mess this is clearly the result of serious lapses and mistakes on the part of all the stakeholders but i would not agree with those who are clamouring for the termination of the ppa by the maharashtra government it could very well ha ppen that we are left with no choice in the end but to cancel the contract but this if at all should be a legal decision and not a business decision the fact of the matter is that we have a large facility established on ind ian soil which we must find ways to use for the benefit of the country i have not seen the plant at all but from all accounts that i have heard e ven from those who regard the whole project as a big mistake this is a ver y well engineered plant to harp on the termination of the contract would b e like cutting your nose to spite your face at no time must the action of the mseb the maharashtra government or the government of india beor even appear to be arbitrary or spiteful the dabhol officials have signaled their willingness to renegotiate the con tract and we must therefore go through the process with an open mind but w ith our position clearly specified namely that of getting a fair deal for the consumer of dabhol power i believe the contract can be renegotiated an d a reasonable tariff hammered out between the parties to the contract and i also believe that the renegotiations should be conducted directly betwe en the parties themselves unencumbered by any group or committee that may have analysed the project the road map for renegotiating the deal has been provided by the committee set up to review the project in the report it ha s submitted to the maharashtra government the rest is a matter of give and take based on how much each stakeholder is willing to concede the various measures outlined in the report clearly indicate the impact tha t these would have on the tariff if all these are followed and the sales t o other customers facilitated such that the plant runs at full capacity th e tariff would come down substantially maharashtra cannot at this stage ab sorb the power produced from the two phases of the project and therefore o ther parts of the country would need to be supplied the bulk of the output from this plant the central and the state governments must facilitate this as part of renegotiated deal which of course would involve a major shift in the position of the promoters of the project in several ways detailed in the report for all practical purposes sales of power by ipps are unrestricted and ca n involve more than one state in the case of dabhol however it was belie ved at the stage of project design that all the power would be absorbed by one state there are today the so called mega power projects where power fr om a particular project will be sold to more than one state but i believe there is a case for greater flexibility in the policy in this regard and ge tting the power trading corporation divested of its monopoly power as the o nly trader for interstate supplies of power from ipps one important feature of the dabhol project is the large lng facility and r elated infrastructure that has been established the answer to the question whether this should be treated as part of the power project depends on the fact whether these facilities are fully dedicated to the production of pow er or have a large surplus capacity in the case of dabhol the latter happe ns to be the case hence it makes both business sense and sound legal logic to separate the two there is no reason why the entire lng infrastructure which has capacity fa r beyond the needs of the power project should not be separated as a disti nctly different profit centre this would bring down the cost of power gene rated significantly and make the whole deal neat and transparent this wou ld be in the nations and the consumers interest the economic times tuesday june bring this sorry saga to end abhay mehta much ado about nothing thats what i think of the dabhol controversy i a m frankly perplexed at the hype and the ado being made on the dabhol issue if after eight years basic issues have not come through even trivially t hen this country is doomed anyway to reiterate the fundamental issues are a what is signed is a contract simpliciter between two parties a contract ing party has agreed to sell another a commodity electricit y for a price in a fixed quantity f or a period of time ie mseb is liable for billion plus rs crore plus a year year on year for the next twenty years these pa yments are indexed to just about all possible economic indices the rise in payments in rupee terms is minimally per cent a year b it is not repeat not a foreign investment one would have hoped that b y now if this nation has even a vestige of economic sense the basic calcu lation of the net foreign investment would be public the substantial over capitalisation the direct lendi ng by indian fis the indirect lending guarantees to by indian fis to foreign fis about per cent of project costs and msebs own equity investments implies th at all the money is indian the net effective investment on enrons part is close to zero or even negative c there is no set of economic circumstances growth rates industry offta ke or even political that will allow the purchase of this power the basic premise that there are buyers for outrageously expensive baseload power is itself fundamentally flawed even in the most power deficient state there is no shortage of power in th e night however the enron meter keeps on ticking in fact at the rate of u s million an hour hour upon hour for hours a day there is no scope for payments of this magnitude even in ideal circumstances d there is little scope for renegotiations in an economically acceptabl e manner all the current talk reduction of fis interest rates sharing of burden etc is largely of no consequence the fundamental issue remains the same overcapitalisation forex linkage s and the profit margins well in excess of those a llowed by law of the order of per cent even on notional equity enron has stated in unequivocal terms that these are issues that are not open to negotiations of any kind e it does not matter if enron leaves given the above big deal that thi s country is unable to do what croatia pakistan and indonesia have done r eflects on india not on enron f the only signal that would go out would be positive one to quote the q uintessential epitome of right wing free market thought the economist w hich wrote at the time of the first cancellation about the india that ca n say no g it is more than possible to terminate the contract without any liabiliti es in either political or economic termination l iabilities even currently enron is in severe breach of its contractual obligations i n any case the condition precedent to the sanctity of the contract the n ecessary clearances are not in place and even an admittedly illegal technical clearance addressed to enron sta tes that construction on phase shall not begin until gommseb ensure comp lete absorption of power this condition has not even been met for phase never mind going ahead with phase enron went ahead on its own risk des pite being aware of the lacunae other more substantive issues as well actio n under the prevention of corruption act d against public servants unknown wherein the act of actually giving or taking money is not to be proved simply that a private party benefited at the expense of the public exchequer jayalalitha in the tansi case as well as the recent cases in the doordarshan case come un der this section these are avenues that ought to be pursed to bring this sorry saga to the e nd it deserves the economic times tuesday june mseb is willing to wheel dpc power vinay bansal under the power purchase agreement the dpc undertook to construct and oper ate a baseload power station at dabhol at all material times it was repre sented to the board that dpc would build maintain and operate a stateoft heart power station for phasei with a nominal baseload capacity of mw it was represented that the power plant will have certain dynamic paramet ers one of the key parameters was the plant capacity to ramp up upto p er cent load within three hours relying upon these representations the mseb consented to the ppa since the commissioning of the phase i plant in may the dpc has been billing ms eb for capacity payments based on the rated baseload capacity for each ava ilability period until january the ramp up capacity had not come int o question nor was mseb told that it was materially different from that st ated in the contract on january however mseb asked for mw in three hours to meet an urgent requirement the dpc however could deliver only mw there were similar defaults in february and march which en titled mseb to rebate as per the ppa the dpc however refused to pay the rebate instead in its letters while admitting that the actual performanc e does not conform to the contract it has disputed msebs rebate claim the board gave sufficient opportunities to resolve the issue but dpc starte d pressurising the board for making payments for december and january had been adjusted against rebate that it had failed to pay then it invoked guarantees of the state and central governments notices of arbi tration were served another notice declaring political force majeure was f ollowed by instructions to our banks to activate escrow accounts finally the dpc issued two preliminary termination notices on may in the opinion of mseb its rebate claims are valid and its consent to the ppa was caused by material misrepresentation we were advised by our lawyer s that the agreement is void andor voidable at our option accordingly th e board issued a notice to dpc on may rescinding the contract to avoid inconvenience to all concerned the board made a very reasonable offer to t he dpc which was without prejudice to continue purchase of power at old t erms till the disputes are resolved provided such payments were later adju sted on the basis of determination by a competent forum but the dpc responded that the board could not have its cake and eat too h aving rescinded the contract if it continued to buy power it would be tak en as affirmation to hold the contract valid therefore we stopped drawing power from the noon of may mseb has been uptodate in payments of its monthly dues including the two bills adjusted against the rebate for thei r latest bill also the board sent the cheque under protest on the due da te the may but the dpc refused to take delivery notwithstanding these differences without prejudice to our respective stan ds both dpc and mseb are seeking an amicable solution to the issue in the forum provided by the godbole committee the average price of supply of dpc power to mseb in the last two years has been about rs per unit we dr ew less last year because of merc restrictions on drawal of this expensive power and the rate for the last twelve months has climbed up to rs per unit since the prevailing consumer tariffs are much lower without prejud ice to our notice rescinding the contract negotiations are continuing in t he godbole committee to reduce the dpc tariff to acceptable levels even to day the dpc is free to sell power to anyone outside the state but it is un willing to become a merchant generator mseb is willing to wheel dpc power if however ipps are allowed to sell p ower within the boards area they will naturally choose the most profitabl e customers namely the ht industrial consumers figures show that our tari ff structure is so distorted that the board subsidises out of consumer s if the con sumer is taken away from the board its losses will mount further the financial express tuesday june dabhol block b not yet commissioned sanjay jog uncertainty looms large over the commissioning of block b of dabho l phaseii by the dabhol power company in view of maharashtra state e lectricity boards decision to rescind power purchase agreement ppa and suspend power purchase since may noonthe dpc which had planned t o commission the block b on june was tight lipped and declined to commen t at this point of time we have nothing to offer replied dpc spokesman on monday on the eve of dabhol lenders meeting in singapore further the fate of performance test to be carried out by dpc in the prese nce of mseb officials also hangs in the balance as the company has already suspended the test runsaccording to section of power purchase agreemen t dpc shall at least seven days before hand give mseb notice of and sha ll invite msebs representatives to attend any performance tests but the f ailure of such representatives to amend will not result in the postponement or failure of any such tests and any tests conducted in relation to the en try into commercial services of the liquified natural gas facility mseb sh all pay dpc the commissioning charges specified in schedule part viii i n respect of such active energy however mseb soures told the financial express that it has not received an y notice from dpc on carrying out performance test these sources said that even if dpc conducts performance test mseb would not join it on the groun ds that it has not only rescinded the ppa but also taken up the matter with the maharashtra electricity regulatory commission the matter is s ubjudice and thus we will not like to be present during performance test t he possibility of dpc going in for an expert test cannot be ruled out sou rces added the performance test is unavoidable to avoid misdeclaration and deliver pow er within minutes from a cold startmseb recalled that dpc had conducte d performance tests in may prior to entry into commercial service of dabhol phasei since may the company had tested the nominal baseload c apacity of the phasei plant and found that it was instead of mw a position later accepted by dpc and mseb thereafter the rated baseload capacity was fixed at mw for each hou r called an availability period the times of india tuesday june ask dpc to pack off demands patkar the leader of narmada bachao andolan medha patkar on monday demanded that e nrons dabhol power company be asked to pack off from india without any com pensation and a judicial inquiry be instituted on all aspects of the agreem ent with dpc addressing a press conference here she alleged that there wa s largescale violation of the rules by the company adding it will be in the interest of maharashtra if the company is asked to leave india patkar said that some politicians with vested interests were trying to scut tle any attempt to institute a judicial enquiry fearing their own exposure in the deal instead of having a project like dpc it would be much better i f the maharashtra state electricity board takes steps to increase it s power generation capacity and contain transmission losses due to theft t he nba leader said patkar also demanded that the central water policy be d rafted as per the recommendations of the report of the world commission of dams big dams do not not yield any projected results whether it is to sol ve the drinking water problem or help in increasing the foodgrain productio n but only create rehabilitation problems she added patkar also critici sed the maharashtra government for diverting large amount of water to suga rcane crops at the cost of other crops

that was in place for eight year s and operating for two years does not exist the denial came as indian an d foreign banks prepared to try to bridge their differences over sustaining support for dabhols power project near bombay which has been supp lying the maharashtra utility a twoday meeting in singapore starting on tuesday will aim to stake out co mmon ground which lenders hope will remove the uncertainty dogging the con troversial power project the indian utility owes dabhol but i s demanding in turn a greater sum in rebates for what it describes as the u s companys failure to meet technical thresholds foreign lenders have stop ped disbursing loans to the second phase of the project which is d ue for completio n soon the first phase was commissioned in may abn amro and bank of america are some of the foreign banks that will thra sh out the issues with state bank of india industrial development bank of india and icici people close to the talks say the situation has worsened since the last l enders meeting in april when dabhol received authorisation to quit the pr oject dabhol has since issued a pretermination notice signalling its int ent to withdraw in six months if a solution is not found mseb has responde d to the threat by abandoning its power purchase contract with the company and has refused to draw any more power dabhol has not generated any power in the last six days msebs decision to stop lifting power alarmed indian banks whose exposure of funded loans and guarantees to the project totals about about per cent of the total debt raised to finance the proj ect foreign banks raised the balance of about there are difference s even among the foreign ones each has a different ap petite for risk but i would not characterise it as a rift said one parti cipant in tuesdays meeting despite the tense atmosphere power industry executives say there is an inc reasing realisation that the banks and dabhol must resolve their difficulti es because this project is too big to fail suresh prabhu indias power minister intervened last week calling on the countrys top power authorit y to look at how dabhols of power might be exported to powerdefici ent states elsewhere in india the dispute has alarmed foreign investors an d rating agencies last week fitch the international rating agency adjus ted the outlook on indias sovereign rating of bb from stable to negative it says central and state government guarantees issued to support infras tructure projects such as enrons amount to per cent of gdp and are co ntingent liabilities of the government enron said at the weekend that it was still operating and open to discussions but there needed to be some sig n from state agencies that they were beginning to reverse practices of den ying obligations under contracts the economic times tuesday june power experts get it wrong sanjeev s ahluwalia state utilities owe rs crore to central power generators alone this is one half of their annual revenues overdue payments equal to eight mont hs of revenue are sure signs of insolvency and financial unsustainability especially when the interest rate for incremental debt of per cent is th ree to four times the growth rate of revenue the government of india set u p a group of experts chaired by dr montek singh ahluwalia to recommend a solution part one of the report was submitted in april here is why t he experts have gone wrong the bulk of the overdue payments to central pow er suppliers are the consequence of an arbitrary and illadvised tariff inc rease in and again in of these central generators the allowed rate for depreciation was raised from per cent to per c ent in the allowed rate of return was increased from per cent to per cent even for existing plants these measures add around rs cro re to the annual revenues of ntpc alone state utilities are however cons trained from passing through such increases by public pressure to keep reta il prices low the result has been cascading volumes of overdue payments fo r power purchase the enron story and the more recent unilateral shut down of the generation facility run by aes in orissa are sequels of the same ma lady enron is being renegotiated presumably because the costs were arbitrary th e experts however failed to recognise a similar arbitrariness in the tari ff increase effected by goi prior to the formation of the central power r egulator the fact is the bulk of these overdues should be waived as they should ne ver have been levied in the first place state utilities face two kinds of financial challenges which impact state government finances the first is tackling the overdue payments or borrowin gs contracted to meet these liabilities the experts have recommended that state governments take responsibility for these overdues by issuing bonds in favour of the creditors this is a welcome step towards fiscal responsib ility since these overdues are the contingent liability of state governmen ts failure to service the bonds or failure to pay future power dues invites h eavy censure including suspension of central transfers these are efficient penalties in themselves where the experts have gone wrong is in ignoring the imbalance in revenue flows while restructuring the stock of overdues r eforms were supposed to bridge the revenue imbalances firstly regulatory commissions were to raise tariffs to meet costs commissions which work in a quasijudicial manner and must needs safeguard the interest of the consu mer have justifiably baulked at passing through inefficient costs the andhra pradesh commission has not raised tariffs at all in s econdly privatisation was supposed to cut costs and improve revenues this has not happened even where the private sector has taken over distributio n as in orissa its capacity for efficiency improvements is now seen to be overrated nor is the private sector willing to finance the transition to financial stabilisation it is therefore the existing state utilities wh ich are now expected to provide efficiency improvements in operations this a tall order in fact the very process of reform provides perverse incentives to let e fficiencies fall and the system to decay pending eventual privatisation th is was the orissa story from to the result is that most reformin g state utilities need a bridge facility to balance the revenue budget the experts have ignored this fact by converting the overdues into equity he ld by central generators and indian financial institutions and thereby faci litating their participation in board level management the state utilities could be assured the commercial autonomy which is key to improving their p erformance however true risk sharing of this nature which is a prospective concept has been ignored by the experts in favour of loss sharing which is a b ackward looking concept and hence self limiting by tackling only the stock and ignoring the flow of future overdues the experts have devised a solut ion which is bound to fail lets take the case of uttar pradesh this ref orming state government has already waived rs crore owed by the stat e utility to it and assumed rs crore of the utilities liabilities i ncluding unfunded pension liabilities in addition it provides rs cro re every year as subsidy and an equal amount as capital infusion the reven ue gap is still around rs crore per year future efficiency improvemen ts will only dilute the incremental revenue mismatch from a per cent annu al increase in supply hence in five years the cumulative revenue gap after subsidy will be rs crore or double the existing level of payments overdue to central gen erators against this requirement the formula allows up to float additiona l bonds for only rs crore leaving an unfinanced gap of rs crore pl us interest on this amount even if up could borrow this amount it would i nflate its fiscal deficit by per cent the resultant interest payments w ould inflate its revenue deficit by per cent or up will need to cut back other revenue expenditure by around rs crore or per cent of total re venue expenditure up is not the exception to this fact states may still opt for the formula despite its limitations however this is not an endorsement of the robust ness of the formula but rather the helplessness of insolvent states it is no ones case that fiscal imbalance should become an excuse for easy money but a package for fiscal stabilisation cannot ignore the differing base lev els of such imbalances both stock and flow within the states incentives and penalties are efficient only when they can induce the required fiscal r esponse by adopting a cookie cutter uniform approach to financial rest ructuring the experts have ensured that only states at the margin or thos e least requiring immediate assistance will corner the lions share of the assistance the author is secretary finance government of up these are his personal views the telegraph singh protest puts sonia in bind on enron rasheed kidwai sunday june sonia gandhi is in a bind over the demand for a judicial probe into the enr on deal due to opposition from manmohan singh and nkp salve maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh is waiting for sonias signal to implemen t the madhav godbole committee report that has recommended a judicial inqui ry into the power purchase agreement if sonia vetoes manmohan and sal ve there will be a question mark over the continuation of the democratic f ront government in maharashtra sharad pawars nationalist congress party h as made it clear that it will part ways in case its alliance partner the c ongress favours a probe there is a sharp division in the congress over th e enron deal madhavrao scindia pranab mukherjee motilal vora murli deor a and arjun singh are in favour of the probe but manmohan is reluctant as t he deal was struck during his tenure as the union finance minister salve then held the power portfolio party leaders said the imageconscious manmohan would take offence though there is nothing that could go against him in the probe he had reportedly not even attended the cabinet meetings in which dabhol power project was d iscussed sonia who chaired the meeting on enron has decided to ascertain the views of the maharashtra congress unit she will go by its opinion a source close to sonia said a section of the maharastra party unit wants sonia to take an aggressive stance and queer the pitch for pawar who was i nstrumental in getting the deal through in case of a judicial probe thre e leaders pawar bal thackeray and atal bihari vajpayee are going to be th e worst affected since the trio is a known enemy of the congress why shou ld we shield them a senior leader from the state who called on sonia to press for the probe asked but another section of the party is opposed to it on the ground that the co ngressncp alliance would fall through the deshmukh government is doing a fine job why should we rock the boat secondly what kind of signal would we be sending to the mncs and investors a party mp askedbut pawars det ractors in the state congress are getting restless according to them the leadership should either work for a merger with the breakaway group or take on pawar to end the confusion over two congresses going by the present mood the merger is unlikely as pawar pa sangma and tariq anwar continue

no longer conserves energy by laura m holson the new york times page column c new york times company san diego jan it was here in the heat of last summer that consumers got their initial lesson in how painful californias experiment with deregulation could be with electricity supplies short and the states power grid on the brink of collapse wholesale electricity costs nearly tripled and the san diego gas and electric company the first utility in the state freed by deregulation passed those costs on to its customers homeowners took to the streets and businesses threatened to leave the city californias second largest logic would suggest that san diego consumers having felt the price shock that the rest of the state so far had been shielded from would be wiser about using electricity than other californians but the price shock was too short in september california legislators called off the experiment capping retail electrical rates at cents a kilowatt hour the average market price paid in the month before the summer crisis now six months later san diegans are back to their old ways electricity use which dropped percent in august is back up to precrisis levels according to san diego gas and electric rather than investing in insulation or energyefficient airconditioners consumers here seem to be hovering between denial and defiance i feel i do all that i can to conserve said vicki barber an escrow coordinator for a real estate broker in san diego but im not going to spend all this money upgrading my house when it doesnt matter anyway as a test laboratory of consumer behavior when the cost of a necessity skyrockets san diego seems confused by how politicians reacted when consumers here revolted last summer demanding relief in september when california legislators restored the lower rates residential and smallbusiness rate payers received credits on their utility bills even though the credits are really a postponed debt that is expected to come due as soon as and it is true that the utilitys largest customers are already paying market rates still jeannie thompsons reaction was typical in august ms thompson the branch manager of a coldwell banker real estate office in the pacific beach district made it her business to turn off office lights and computers every night when the news first came out you wanted to do your part she said then in october the office got its credit and we started to go back to the way things were before economists look at san diegans behavior and draw this lesson consumers must suffer a lot before they willingly give up comfort and conveniences they have grown used to summer should have been a wakeup call said peter navarro associate professor of economics and public policy at the university of california at irvine you cant blame san diego consumers for not doing anything because legislators stepped in and lowered prices if the discomfort isnt of a lengthy duration the adjustments to behavior that need to take place wont indeed in a recent paper a group of energy experts and economists including two nobel prize winners made the same point saying that if consumers knew the true cost of electricity they would conserve more even gov gray davis seems to be backing away from his promise that rates would not rise but san diego consumers once again insulated from rate increases have shrugged off the crisis in part because they have taken to heart the governors oftrepeated claim that the problems are the fault of outofstate power generators that need to be reined in ask these people if they feel safe at night pete phelps said wryly of those generators mr phelps an airline pilot was with his wife pat loading a gallon water heater into the back of his pickup truck at a home depot near the san diego sports arena mrs phelps added you dont know what is legitimate who to believe so the phelpses have done little in recent months to conserve except turning off lights as their monthly electricity bill has climbed to from about in the past two years their new water heater was billed as energy efficient and while it should save them a year they did not buy it with conservation in mind i spill that in beer money mr phelps said high prices alone cannot change consumer behavior mr navarro the economist said if consumers for instance believe that turning off lights benefits someone other than themselves they will feel no incentive to conserve that he said is the situation in the pacific northwest where many residents believe that any power they save will simply be diverted to hot tubs in the san francisco suburbs but in san diego people have gotten a particularly mixed message to begin with high rates did not last long enough to make an impact rather the lingering impression was that legislators would step in to protect consumers at any cost the math said severin borenstein director of the university of california energy institute was simple if you go from cents to cents to cents then the response will be to weather the storm mr borenstein said referring to the price of a kilowatt hour but if it stays at cents then it makes sense for people to go out and invest in ways to save energy mr borenstein drew a parallel to the gasoline shortages of the s at first he said motorists demonized middle east oil producers as lines of cars snaked around gasoline stations waiting for rationed supplies only after high prices persisted did consumers begin to change their habits buying more fuelefficient cars he said still some san diegans insist that they are pitching in i have not put the heat on said ms thompson the real estate agent i close my doors and put on a sweater but she has not had an energy audit of her home a service provided by san diego gas and electric or bought energysaving appliances during last summers price spike surveys by san diego gas and electric found that percent of its million users did not think the utility was being wholly honest with them about the crisis said stephen l baum chairman of sempra energy the utilitys parent company and there is bound to be more anger now that the utility has requested a surcharge of about percent in march to pay off million it owes its power suppliers higher rates will also make life harder for people who are just getting by at a recent outdoor farmers market in el cajon a workingclass town miles east of san diego heidi van horn a massage therapist and her fiance bernie herloss a handyman were supplementing their monthly income by selling grilled bratwurst and hamburgers to hungry shoppers for the twobedroom apartment they share the couple have in pastdue energy bills those bills hover at about a month up from two years ago we arent one of these highrollers who make an hour ms van horn said we either pay the electricity or have the phone shut off even so she said they do what they can to conserve turning down the thermostat or turning off the occasional light but their apartment building is poorly insulated cold wind seeps in through closed windows and the heating vents are near the ceiling where the warmth is wasted their only energyefficient light bulb is the one that came in the mail from san diego gas and electric and the two birds and the iguana they keep ms van horn said would die if she turned off any of the three heat lamps that run continuously in the apartment she would never consider getting rid of the pets ms van horn said they are family"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody", "pk": 300, "fields": {"body_text": "for your information i have been advised by facilities that

is the preferred platform in a single southeast rto sen shelby reluctance to mandate rtos sympathy for incentives for voluntary rtos not much interest in giving ferc more jurisdiction on anything skepticism that senate will act on electricity legislation sen bingaman staff remains our strongest senate supporters of large rtos open to our suggestions on transparency and market based rates looks

mems friday featurecharlie burgers eve of disruption poll questionadieu lucent readings conference calendar in the american spectatorthe coming boom in every era the definitive abundance is revealed by the price of a key factor of production plummeting over a cliff of costs and releasing like a giant river reaching a falls the key resource releases a surge of kinetic energy into the economy as the price drops from horsepower to kilowatt hours the countries companies and individuals that exploit the evercheaper resource gain market share against all others and end up casting the character of the age over the last forty years the key resource has been transistors and bits of memory the new era however will ride a new factor of production over a new paradigm cliff the price of communications bandwidth falling between two and ten times as fast as the fall in the price of transistors the plummeting price of a key resource creates what my friend andy kessler calls a lowpressure area in the economy lowpressure systems pull in weather from elsewherestorms conventional economists have long favored equilibriumeconomies that gravitate toward perfect balance blue skies and moderate weather this remains the ideal of eurosclerosis in entrepreneurial economies however lowpressure zones such as silicon valley concentrate energy in spirals of growth twisters of creative destruction driving todays lowpressure economy is the rampant spread of the internet and its transformation through the power of fiber optics the internet lowers the cost of transactions of price information and of search and facilitates the setting of prices the internet saves the key scarcity of the new economy of abundancetime extending markets and proliferating new products it lowers the cost of capitalism and raises the comparative price of socialist policy the lowpressure economy drives prices down most dramatically in the highest growth sectors such as technologyand these low prices reverberate throughout the economy pondering the numbers many economists will continue to warn against inflation and call for tighter money as they did throughout much of the great depression they will oppose tax rate reductions in order to pay back debt or balance the budget as americans did in the and the japanese did during the if the current administration and federal reserve follow those welltrodden paths of failure they will delay the tidal wave of new growth but they cannot stop it the world economy is increasingly unified and if the us gives up leadership other countries will move into the lowpressure breach bad policy can drive american venture capital overseas just as bad policy in japan and europe shifted capital to the us over the last two decades but the telecosm will still prevail and investors who understand its dimensions will be able to spurn the catastrophists and prosper from the largest opportunity in the history of the world economy george gilder excerpted

call a successful campaign enjoy it its an intense time and you cant slack off n ow but its also important to enjoy the moment regardless of what happens in t he next few weeks its tough enough just to get to this point great w ork from my perspective its interesting in that the actual number of folks who read the material drops way off this time of year but the other side of the coin is that the interest level of the ones still reading shoots throu gh the roof there may not be as many folks reading as there were in september but the ones that are here are into in a big way ill do my dead level best to keep up my end of the bargain and provide the best info i can all the way to the week games lets get at it joe matchups to avoid and exploit passing game matchups heres how i see the matchups this week please note see the cheatsheet online will be availablelate wednesday evening at for exactly where i rank players and to determine who to start just because one matchup may be mor e favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean id start the player with the best matchup the matchup info is meant to be just one more too l in your box when it comes to deciding between players note ive used the player stats sorted by performance over the last f our weeks extensively in developing these writeups stats are provided by mik e halls excellent flm league management software f or more info the fantasy points allowed by position numbers are from espncom here we go locks these games heavily favor the offense new orleans passing game vs bronco defense i stuck my neck out a bit last week with qb aaron brooks but he came though for me this week he draws a great matchup with a denver defense thats not been able to sto p anyone through the air over the last four weeks they rank in passi ng yards allowed per game denver has averaged giving up yards passing p er game over that span with cb ray crockett out with a torn hamstring jim my spencer will fill in for him again this week he and terrell buckley can definitely be beaten brooks will focus on wr joe horn his primary weapon but willie jackson refuses to fade away and is a solid option rb chad morton catches the ball pretty well out of the backfield te aaron glove r still is total non factor for fantasy purposes im doing my best to not get carried away with brooks keep telling yourself the young man has exactly games of nfl experience on the other hand there comes a time when you take a leap and go with what you see with your own eyes this gu y isnt playing like a game rookie and the denver defense is awful st louis passing game vs carolina defense i want to believe i believe in kurt warner and i believe hell get his rams back on track as much as anything i believe youll see marshall faulk at least see more action than he saw last week warners an mvp but i think its faulk that make s this team go he creates so much havoc with the defense that must either commi t safeties to support the run which then opens the passing game if the defense plays the pass then faulk can kill them with the run or short passes after last week id be shocked if coach mike martz doesnt get back to utilizinghisstar rbmore kurt warner makes his return and i m guessing he picks up where he left off thats not what youd expec t to happen but warners made a career of exceeding expectations if he s on your roster i think you have to go with him especially against this defense carolina ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for wrs its always tough to pick isaac bruce and torry holt are the sure guys but honestly ricky proehls been on fire lately azzahir hakim is always worth a shot too any one of these guy s can go off te roland williams suffers with so many good receivers but he s a decent producer too atlanta passing game vs seattle defense this one is a pure matchup play as dan reeves makes the move for startingqb doug johnson over the fading chris chandler im not a big fan of either but if you find yourself f aced with the prospect of starting a falcon qb this is the week to do it if yo u re ever going to the seahawks defense is less like a hawk and more like an albatross around mike holmgrens neck theyre awful over the last four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game good luck picki ng the wr as terrance mathis has been invisible lately while shawn jefferson is making a resurgence a few weeks ago it was mathis who was hot while jefferson faded if you made me pick one id reluctantly go with jefferson te reggie kelly did catch passes sunday but im not count ing on him for too much pittsburgh passing game vs raider defense kordellkordellkorde ll what brought this guy back to life i dunno but you can bet coach bill cowher is going to do everything he can to keep it rolling kordell stewar t looks to be playing with renewed confidence and we all know that so much o f the game at this level is mental no one ever doubted his physical skills the obvious spark seems to have been the benching of wr plaxico burress and the inspired play of hines ward i think its ironic that w ard was very much a kordelllike player in college at georgia bobby shaw is getting into the act and producing from the wr slot and wonders of wonders te mark bruener caught a td sunday you know things are changin g when bruener gets in the endzone the raiders are an extremely good football team but stopping teams through the air is their achilles heel cincinnati passing game vs cardinal defense another interesting aspect o f writing this column late in the season is that you can almost guess which players to talk about as most fantasy teams still interested in december ar e stocked with the obvious stars qb scott mitchell likely doesnt fall into that category and i doubt many folks are faced with the decis ion to start him this week but if hes your best qb this might be your lucky week first of all lets assume he gets the knee ready to go this e arly in the week thats honestly a shaky assumption well know more l ater but if he can go he could do some damage against an awful cardinal defense wr peter warrick could be a decent play too although aeneas williams is a solid cover guy hes hard to count out though just beca use of his home run ability funny how i dont see many people complaining about his times now rb corey dillon is the only other starter on this team but well catch up with him in the rushing matchups prime matchups these games favor the offense arizona passing game vs bengal defense lets be clear im no jake plummer fan but the truth of the matter is hes got a pretty decent matc hup this week hes reportedly making good progress and should start sunda y partly because hes better partly because dave brown was just awful than plummer has a nasty ring to it but this bengal pa ss defense is pretty bad over the past four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game wrs david boston has the physical tools to do some damage and frank sanders has the experience to make an impact remember this is the unit that made pittsburgh look like the rams last week new york jets passing game vs colts defense the jets have been up and do wn a bit but this week they could make some noise against a struggling indianapolis defense the pathetic colt pass rush only has sacks in th e last games qb vinny testeverde had a decent day in their last matchup with yards and td wr wayne chrebets been in a funk lately but in their week he went off catching passes for sure some of it was late but garbage stats count too dedric ward caught just yards worth of passes but he scored in that game hes come on lately after fadin g early rookie wr laveranues coles will miss another game it appears rb curtis martin still is struggling to get healthy and that will hurt a little te anthony becht is a bright spot as hes beginning to contrib ute december in new york will make a difference to this soft colt team which doesnt play as well in the cold detroit passing game vs viking defense charlie batch continued to look good and went a good ways toward erasing some of his candybone label with a gutsy performance on thanksgiving his ribs are reportedly better and he had a nice practice tuesday throwing the ball the viking secondary could have matchup troubles with wrs johnnie morton a nd herman moore over the last four weeks minnesota ranks in passing yards allowed per game for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing qbs the vikings are tough on tes ranking in fantasy points allowed to tes for the year but te david sloan has played very well of late he ranks in fantasy points among tes over the last games and is well worth a start here denver passing game vs saints defense for all the hype generated by new orleans defense they give up tons of yards passing over the last fo ur weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game they do sack the qb a ton but they still give up the yards i t s kind of unusual to see that theyll be facing gus frerotte and a den ver team thats trying to find their way frerottes been up and down after his monster week game the saints continue to drop like flies and the loss of cb fred weary will definitely hurt both wrs rod smith and ed mccaffrey are solid plays as always and as crazy as it sounds either one of the headed te monster in dwayne carswell and desmond clark are decen t options too byron chamberlain normally makes it a headed te monster bu t hes nursing a bad achilles tendon and didnt play last week as no ted above denver gives up lots of yards through the air so this could be a hig h scoring affair i doubt you could have predicted a shootout between aaron brooks and gus frerotte months ago but thats why they play the games even matchups these games feature no real advantage either way chicago passing game vs packer defense im torn here you probably saw how weak the packer defense looked monday night they couldnt do muc h of anything but on the other hand the bears will likely go with shane matthews and hes been just awful lately like worse than dave brown kind of bad one would think hed improve against this defense but hell have to make great strides just to get reach owners of wr marcus robinson feel it too as the big guy has pretty much disappeared lately wit h matthews at the helm still though theres some hope on a brighter spot matthews does seem comfortable throwing to eddie kennison who had passes thrown to him sunday compared to robinsons ive hear rum ors that chicago may start a te but that news is unconfirmed at this time in t he for real rumor department qb cade mcnown is making noise about wanting to start this week but i think its still a week early new england passing game vs chief defense kansas city and new england ar e two once proud teams that are struggling this week a banged up drew bledsoefaces a pass defense thats been vulnerable over the last fou r weeks kansas city ranks in passing yards allowed per game for the year kc ranks in fantasy points allowed to opposing qbs bledsoe bruised a knee in thursdays game but played through it and should be o k keep an eye on him though as he was added to the injury report this week a s questionable as long as bledsoe plays wr terry glennshould be a good option as hes clearly the guy in that offense over troy brown te rod rutledge caught passes last week so he may start to make some noise with all those productive years throwing to ben coates you know bledsoe would love to have a solid te"}},

salvosa manager of government affairs date august re august joint legislativeregulatory affairs meeting on reliability legislation summary of epsa position exploration of future initiatives the august meeting on august the epsas legislative and regulatory affairs committees met to review and discuss existing proposals on reliability legislation dave nevius of nerc explained the current draft of the socalled stakeholder consensus bill and bobby lamb presented the competing proposal being advanced by pjm after these presentations nevius and lamb responded to numerous questions thereafter epsa members discussed the relative merits of the two proposals concluding with a straw poll indicating support for exploring an alternative to nercs bill specifically epsa members expressed general dissatisfaction with the new streamlined version of the nerc bill additionally serious doubts exist regarding the possibility of revising the language in the nerc bill in any way that would make it acceptable general observations about the fundamental aspects of the nerc bill indicated that people are not comfortable shifting authority away form ferc to an overly complex prescriptive organization with uncertain delegations of enforcement authority to regional entities regarding alternatives there was consensus that the general approach contained in the pjm proposal subject to additional work to resolve several weaknesses could become an acceptable vehicle for addressing reliability issues while epsa members clearly are leaning toward the pjm bill the proposals raises serious questions concerning the states role regarding adequacy and their right to adopt more stringent standards based upon compelling need even if inconsistent with national standards and limited provision for coordination with canada and mexico the pjm proposal pjms proposal contains a number of positive aspects including its simplicity it is only pages long members and staff on capitol hill have repeatedly pleaded for a shorter version of reliability legislation the pjm proposal is at least pages shorter than the nerc bill ferc and the rtos would have primary jurisdiction over development and enforcement of reliability standards the nerc language gives substantial deference to the ero and accompanying arres eisb with the expected approval of the formation of eisb at the upcoming meeting of the gisb board on september coupled with strong support from ferc commissioners wood brownell and massey the pjm proposal allows an opportunity to incorporate eisb the nerc bill is unclear how an eisb would be accommodated if at all some issues raising concern which need to be addressed include state role the language contains a savings provision which would defer to each state to enforce standards within their boundaries only through applications from affected parties can ferc review state actions and may delay such state action although it does not specifically state that it can prevent it international issues specifically interfaces with canada and mexico the language expresses the need to establish harmonious reliability standards with each country throughout the north american region while simply instructing ferc to do so pjms proposal may need to more clearly explain how to this would be accomplished variances the nerc language presently allows for interconnection wide variances the wscc favors this approach and the senate energy committee with the bulk of its membership from the west region may have something to say about the lack of ability for a region to request a variance whether or not a compromise can be formulated is something we will need to explore next steps the game plan is to open a dialogue with proponents of the pjm bill in order to discuss how best to improve the language to remove potential obstacles to its attracting wider support while this memo summarizes several key issues there may be others which will need to be discussed please bring these ideas up for discussion during the naero working group conference call scheduled for tuesday september at pm including any suggested language and changes to improve the

reading this email please see the document on our website under pressroom publications august vol no pittsburgh a golden opportunity for renewable energy the end of large stranded cost charges to consumers will usher in a golden opportunity next year for the pittsburgh area to become the renewable energy capital of america in the duquesne light service territory in rates for some customers approached percent above the national average with residential customers paying more than cents per kilowatthour of this cents plus total about cents was for just generation and what did consumers get for this premium cents generation price well above any price including for todays percent renewable energy products seen in pennsylvanias competitive retail market since did they get clean and safe energy not unless you believe that coal and uranium are renewable resources in fact the pittsburgh area was powered by incredibly expensive nuclear plants that often were shut down more than they ran as well as some of the highly polluting coal plants that kill pennsylvanians each year with microscopic dirt cause acid rain produce smog and contribute to global warming both the pollution and the high costs were jammed down the throats of consumers by monopolyfriendly regulators those who challenged the legacy of high rates and dirty power and asked the old pennsylvania monopoly utilities about renewable energy were often lectured that renewable energy technology would cost more or was not practical todays competitive retail market shows how wrong those lectures were right now in pittsburgh four competitive suppliers are offering percent renewable energy products for prices ranging from cents to cents per kwh those prices are less than the cents duquesnes customers paid for coal and nuke generation five years ago in fact they are more than a full cent less per kwh since renewable energy products exist in the marketplace are exponentially cleaner and cost less than duquesnes traditional power products why have they so far not swept the marketplace can you say stranded costs or competitive transition charges customers who switch to renewable energy products pay not just the price of the product but also a regulatory stranded cost charge of up to cents per kwh on a system average basis the stranded cost charge is percent of each customers total electric bill and for residential customers it is a whopping percent of the total electric bill the stranded cost charge is paid even if you switch from duquesne light to another company and allows duquesne to recover uneconomic investments in nuclear power made when it was a regulated generation monopoly without the collection of stranded cost charges duquesne may have gone bankrupt yet adding the stranded cost charge to the otherwise less costly renewable energy products has the effect of increasing a customers total bill when she bought renewable energy products thus stranded cost charges are a real barrier to renewable energy products and other competitive retail electric products but in in the duquesne light service territory the regulatory ball and chain of stranded cost charges will be eliminated by giving a large total rate cut of probably percent to all residential customers and by increasing the shopping credit from cents to about cents for residential customers the removal of stranded cost charges means many pittsburgharea customers will soon be able to switch to renewable energy products and pay less or no more than what they were paying for electricity in yes they could save even more by buying even lower cost dirty power products but the coming opportunity to power pittsburgh with renewable energy and pay less than bills is a onceinacentury chance the duquesne transition the reason why duquesne will be the first pennsylvania utility to eliminate stranded cost charges is its successful sale of its generation plant duquesne first swapped some generating assets with firstenergy and then sold all of its generating assets to orion while contracting with orion to continue to provide default service to duquesnes native load customers duquesne has provided distribution service and orion has provided default generation service at capped rates without notable problems without a former monopoly utility with a vested interest in keeping generation customers a far greater portion of customers switched to a competitive supplier than anywhere else in the us competitive suppliers now serve about percent of all duquesne customers the number of duquesne customers served by competitive suppliers rose steadily until peaking in late at about held steady through spring and then declined to about as of july the recent decline occurred when retail offers exceeded the systems shopping credit but remained well below duquesnes generation rate of cents today there are four competitive suppliers offering six different products to residential customers in the duquesne territory one of which is priced below the shopping credit and enables customers to switch and save and four of which are renewable energy products recent sharp declines of more than percent in forward electric markets make it likely that more products will soon be able to beat the current duquesne shopping credit of cents and of course the cent monopoly rate after the two remaining principal impediments of completing a successful transition to competition in the duquesne light service territory will be the full integration of its control area and wholesale market into pjm and wide deployment of demandresponse technologies timeofuse meters and appliancecontrol devices allow customers to profit from reducing usage in summer peak hours protect reliability reduce market power and can lessen pollution the failure to achieve pjm integration and demand response could derail the benefits of stranded cost elimination and what has been so far a successful transition for the duquesne service territory no more stranded costs stranded cost charges will likely be first removed for residential customers starting in march up until now average system customers have had to pay cents on every dollar paid for total electric service so that duquesne could recover its stranded costs with the end of stranded cost charges different classes of customers will receive a substantial rate cut current prices for electric service from duquesne light rs rate gs gl distribution transmission generation ctc portion of gen shopping credit total the portion of the bill that is the competitive transition charge represents the basic rate reduction that each class will enjoy when the charges are terminated the charges are scheduled to end in march for general residential customers april for smaller commercial customers and september for larger commercial customers the charges end for other customer classes as late as april residential customers using kwhmonth for example will stop paying centskwh for stranded costs reducing their total electric bill by percent real market prices generation rates will still be regulated for customers receiving default generation service under duquesnes contract with orion however the rates will no longer reflect the remnants of prerestructuring costofservice rates instead they will be based on market rates when the puc approved the sale of duquesnes generating plants and the transfer of the default service to orion it approved tentative default rates at market prices as determined by the duquesne contract with orion the precise level of default rates remains unknown however consumers would see total rate reductions of about percent if the default rate is set at centskwh and a total rate cut of percent if it is pegged at cents again these default rates are well below the cent monopoly rate although the duquesneorion contract set and the puc approved the default rates the rates did not assume that duquesne would be joining pjm west there have been some nonpublic discussions taking place between the puc orion and duquesne as well as some public discussions but at this point it is unclear whether the existing rates should or will be adjusted whatever the precise answer the puc needs to move these proceedings to the public domain and resolve the issues expeditiously so that customers and suppliers may plan to take advantage of the new market opportunities competitive market opportunities in the shopping credit will increase for customers who choose to buy generation from a competitive supplier instead of orions default service given reasonable assumptions about market prices and what the shopping credit may be it appears that competitive suppliers will have substantial opportunities to provide competitive service at prices below the shopping credit for example if the present residential shopping credit of centskwh is raised to centskwh as presently scheduled consumers would have a modest opportunity to save by shopping in addition to the savings that all customers including those remaining on default generation service will experience from the end of stranded cost charges if the residential shopping credit is increased to about centskwh suppliers competing on price would have a substantial opportunity to offer consumers meaningful savings by shopping one might presume that the percent of all customers already shopping in the duquesne service territory include many of those most interested in shopping will the opportunity to save a bit more after receiving a percent rate decrease without shopping be sufficient to entice many of the remaining customers to shop setting the rate too low will provide a disincentive to shop by delivering even more savings to nonshopping customers who already will be getting a huge rate cut because of the end of the stranded cost charges given that market rates are a prediction that no one has been making accurately perhaps the puc should err on the high side to increase competitive market opportunities there is no better time for doing so than when all customers are about to receive a huge rate cut from the elimination of stranded cost charges renewable energys time is now even moderate additional shopping based on price does not mean a noncompetitive market however perhaps the most successful competitive suppliers will be those that offer products or services that encourage customers to switch for reasons other than price renewable energy energy efficiency and demandside response products may well provide suppliers with the competitive edge the opportunity for renewable energy market penetration is in fact unprecedented two new wind farms are under construction at this time in somerset and fayette counties bringing the total installed wind capacity in the region to about megawatts two additional wind farms are under development in the same area and another is under development about miles across the state line in west virginia potentially bringing an additional mw of wind power to serve the pittsburgh market depending on the precise shopping credit it is likely that wind electricity from these developments could be sold to retail customers at prices close to or not too far above the shopping credit even if buying renewable energy is not the lowest cost option consumers would still be investing a portion of their percent rate cut in renewable generation and still receive a reduction in their electric bill from what is now paid for example a residential customer could buy one of the five renewable products presently available to consumers in the duquesne territory and still save from cent to cents per kwh alternatively consumers probably will be able to buy percent wind energy and still receive a total electric bill more than percent less than it is today and was in large institutions government agencies businesses and families can without

the control area only that we have visibility to we will be checking for available capacity and we will be extending or inserting supplemental energy bids on behalf of the sc to include the extra capacity the bids for the additional energy will be priced at units awarded regulation will not be subject to iso capacity checking and therefore not subject to bid extending or inserting if a unit has not submitted a supplemental energy bid we will only generate a new supp energy bid for that unit if it appears to be available and dispatchable during realtime in order to facilitate that we are using the following criteria the unit is a combustion turbine the unit has a nonzero hour ahead schedule or the unit has been awarded ancillary services submittal of single heat rate and emission rate points or no points for those units that have only submitted data for one operating point and are capable of generating over multiple operating ranges or in general cases where we believe the data to be inadequate we will substitute the operating point with the data from current or preexisting rmr contracts where possible if rmr data does not exist for a unit we reserve the right to use other data from other sources to replace the submitted data for those units that have not submitted any data we will assume the unit is a price taker and generate proxy bids at for those of you trying to cover your gmms a sc asked about what happens when they have to overgenerate above their hour ahead schedule to cover their gmm and then we dispatch them the difference between pmax and their ha schedule to comply with the ferc order example sc has a unit their gmm is or about mw of losses they usually submit an ha schedule of mw and generate at mw to cover the gmm the answer is that a unit that keeps the iso apprised of its availability in realtime and performs in accordance with its bid characteristics when dispatched should not receive penalties a unit with a final ha schedule of mw that is dispatched for the additional mw and generates mw according to meter data will not be penalized under ct the total obligation for ct for a unit that is dispatched for incremental energy is final ha schedule of instructed incremental energy the total obligation for the hour is compared to the hourly meter value for that unit and is not adjusted for transmission losses ie gmm is not taken into account currently penalties for failure to perform are assessed on an hourly basis however ct may be assessed on an interval basis in the future so the total obligation for the unit is mw mw mw which is less than the meter of mw for ct purposes this unit will not receive any penalties it is important to note that there is a tolerance or mw for instructed energy less than mw on ct penalties if the unit is instructed for less than mw mw will be taken off of the instructed incremental energy instead of this means that any unit that has an incremental instruction for mw or less would not be flagged for ct review for other settlement charge types such as ct and no pay charges on spin nonspin and replacement a unit is required to provide the instructed energy plus any transmission losses

from the onetravelcom experts holiday travel is arduous at best but some planning and mental programming can save your sanity by now you have your tickets for thanksgiving travel unless you are going to travel on thanksgiving day and should be booking soon if you are traveling over the hanukkah christmas or new years holidays this done consider the following tips as your travel travails begin we all agree th at the easiest way to make holiday travel better is to be flexible and keep a positive mental attitude while the latter may be hard at times just step back and take a deep breath confrontation will only make things get worse you can always be right later packing and preshipping ideas with a bit of planning you can travel with just one wheeled carryon and a small carryon bag for an overnighter or a twoweek trip no lost luggage no misrouted or stolen bags and if you miss a connection you can rebook and hop on another plane with all of your baggage in tow for extra comfort replace your shoulder bag strap with a padded golf bag strap or consider using a backpack with two straps to balance the weight evenly feet can suffer during travel so make sure to wear your most comfortable shoes to t he airport visualize your luggage as a box full of air all you need to do is fill up the air spaces in the most compressed manner rolling or folding and overlapping clothes works best place socks and underwear into shoes and fill every available space miniaturize your toiletries by pouring small amounts of shampoos lotions and other necessities into reusable plastic travel bottles you can pack these in a fraction of the space pack only wardrobe essentials plan to dress in neutrals tans grays blacks wit h some white or accent color for versatility and saved space pack with plastic bags to keep clothes from wrinkling if you are taking christmas gifts or a special thanksgiving dinner treat consider ups airborne fedex and the like the items will arrive ahead of you and theres no chance of them being crushed in the overhead bin by someone who doesnt know whats inside if kids are part of your entourage make sure that they pack their own smal l bag of carryon toys and games to keep them occupied pack snacks and a surprise in your carryon for them as well when traveling with children travel early with your longest leg over their nap time the white noise of the plane train or family car will lull them to sleep and give you a chanc e to catch your breath as well most airlines have increased their charges for pets in the cabin and baggag e hold it may cost you between and to take your pet along for the holidays consider a kennel stay or have a neighbor care for your pet whi le you are gone travel especially by air can be very traumatic for your pe t getting to the airport or train strongly consider public transportation such as a taxi or an airport shuttle if a friend owes you a favor now is the time to cash it in the airport lots will be full and if you dont allow enough time you may pani c while you circle the lot looking for a spot at the airport the air transport association is expecting record numbers of travelers this thanksgiving holiday even with these numbers there are things you can do to help make your trip as hasslefree as possible plan to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your scheduled departure leave for the airport early enough to allow extra time for increased airport traffic parking trouble and longer luggage checkin and security screening lines with most airfares you can stand by for an earlier or later sameday flight so if you are at the airport early there is always a chance you can get out of town on an earlier flight note if y ou do not have advance seat assignments you may want to arrive at the airport even earlier make sure all baggage has your name on the outside if you do not have a baggage identification tag the airline will provide you with one have your photo identification ready for the agent at checkin although most airline rules read that they may cancel your reservation if y ou are not at the departure gate ready to board at least minutes before departure dont press your luck plan to be at the departure gate read y to board at least minutes before departure when it is time to board board the plane may not move until everyone is seated and all carryon baggage is stowed keep it simple board the plane stow your stuff sit down and buckle your seat belt although the airlines tell us that it is not necessary to reconfirm return domestic flights we do and we recommend you do too as soon as you arriv e at your destination contact the airline to reconfirm your return flight an d leave a phone number where you can be reached next week tips for keeping kids

minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him during the reign of david more than musicians were assigned to sing in the temple night and day it is the mark of spiritfilled christians to sing and make melody in their hearts to the lord and speak to each other in psalms hymns and spiritual songs on the other side of the truth lies the destructive power of secular music a former satanic high priest showed me numerous symbols on popular record albums indicating commitment and bondage to satanism he told me that about percent of todays heavy metal and punk music groups are owned by satanists they have unwittingly sold themselves to satanism in exchange for fame and fortune few of these artists actually practice satanism but most are hopelessly lost and lead others astray through the godless message in their music god created sound and formed our bodies to respond to it our ears pick up the sound around us and send a signal to the brain some sounds irritate us others soothe us

{"body_text": "jeff are you planning on being at the cpuc on thursday expanding socal supply transport on cpuc agenda california regulators this week could start to remove some of the uncertainty surrounding the instate markets in the first of a series of natural gas infrastructure decisions that ultimately could greatly expand the two major utility intrastate transmissionstorage systems when the california public utilities commission meets in a special continuation business session thursday it will consider allowing southern california gas co to free up about bcf of cushion gas at its idle montebello underground storage facility slated to eventually be abandoned however a bigger move by the cpuc would be to act on the longstalled comprehensive settlement to open up the socals intrastate transmission and storage system the cpuc held an en banc information hearing for its five commissioners earlier in may to hear arguments for and against the settlement indications are the commissioners are ready to move but it would still take several months of processing before a comprehensive settlement could be okayed by the state regulators it appears to be back on radar screen and were still hopeful that they will do the right thing said lad lorenz gas operations director at socalgas they are apparently taking a fresh look at the whole thing but they havent given any indication when they might act socalgas has been criticized by a coalition of southern california generators for having little incentive to expand its pipeline capacity because of current rules that allow it to resell supply and related services in a tight market added pipeline capacity could hurt socals storage business some critics charge the uncertainty of what the ultimate regulatory structure is going to be on a goingforward basis is causing everyone in the market including us concern making it difficult to make decisions said lorenz noting that socal since last august has had a proposed global settlement before the regulators part of the provisions of the overall settlement lorenz said would make it easier for determining when system expansions are necessary because it is based on customer commitments and contracts for capacity on the system absent that were in the current regulatory system and we build the system based on consumer needs he said weve always done that and we havent had any curtailments in years now he added that socal doesnt expect shortages when things get tight this summer under the current scheme however socal determines new construction on a leastcost basis and then tries to recover the costs in the next rate case another problem with the current design is that socal cannot sign up customers for firm backbone transmission with guaranteed receipt and delivery points the proposed settlement would allow socal to hold open seasons for specific points to determine customer interest customers could either commit to new capacity on an incremental cost basis or socal could seek rolledin rates for expansion projects this is the system the states other major gas utility pacific gas electric co has in place despite the rigors of the bankruptcy court the pg utility has scheduled an open season for expansion of its backbone and storage system in a proposal it intends to make to the cpuc later in june see daily gpi may while its pipe and storage infrastructures are thought to be adequate for this year the pg utility is expecting continued high load factors and prices over the summer and winter periods of concern to both utilities is the current interest among elected officials and regulators to increase reserve margins to the doubledigit levels their question is who is going to pay for maintaining the excess capacity the same question applies to the electric side too in implementing current plans to add mmcfd of pipeline capacity socalgas would increase its overall capacity to about bcfd our indications are that is going to be more than adequate and will add substantial excess capacity socals lorenz said see daily gpi may the existing expansions now before the cpuc but not part of the global settlement struck last year would be reevaluated in light of the settlement should it be adopted in the next two or three months lorenz said"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody", "pk": 609, "fields": {"body_text": "when thursday

meeting to discuss about it instead of reading this long email you know any individual product has two risk componentsunique risk and market risk most products in energy industry have very high market risk and very low unique risk for example a price of gas produced from texas is highly correlated with the henry hub spot price since the market risk plays an important role in the energy commodities prices people buy and sell commodities or their derivatives mainly for hedging purposeto reduce their market risk however the movie market is quite different than other commodity markets the gross box office receipt of the little mermaid has low correlation with the sum of gross box office receipts of all movies releasing at the same period an individual movie has very high unique risk and very low market risk if you remember the consultant last friday said that if we own about movies their combined total revenue would be pretty much accurately forecasted that means movies market risk is low and hedging is not important comparing to diversification since the unique risk plays an important role in the movie market i would expect that most of our customers would buy and sell for diversification purpose not for hedging purpose the producer of some movies would sells part of their movies and buy part of the other movies to diversify their unique risk i think we are going into the right direction by creating this movie market so people who long on a small set of movies can sell part of them and buy some parts of other movies the buyers and sellers in this market can all just be the people who naturally long on some slates of movies they will sell some of their own and buy some of others i think the idea on grouping a small number of movies to increase liquidity is good but we need to make sure that diversification can still be done through this market if enron wants to take some position i would recommend that we must be diversified enough we should avoid taking a position on a small number of movies otherwise we will be just an inefficient gambler like putting all the money into only one or two stocks we could have made the same expected return with a lot less risk by investing in s for your questions about the bidask pricing system that i proposed in the previous email if there are no buyers the tentative bidask prices would be very low so we tell the seller to reduce their selling price to this level if they still want to sell to us we can set our bid price to be low enough by subtracting its unique risk premiuminsurance premiumso now we can take this position and behave like an insurance company but we need to have a significant numbers of similar deals of other movies i agree that leaving open orders for several days might be a problem we can set the bidding period to be just only day and everything is cleared at the end of the day i have not seen other markets using this dynamic bidask pricing system and the idea was just came up by myself so i believe it is new i plan to write a memo explaining the details of this system and send it to you dear everyone please correct me if i am wrong thanks chonawee"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody", "pk":

tully janszen of keller on august he picked texas over oklahoma he had considered only texas ou and a and had offers from all three the longhorns who have had three straight top five national recruiting classes are on track to make it four in a row they already have pledges from six recruits who have been on one or more national top lists including three other dt prospects sonny davis of gulf coast jc in mississippi and formerly of austin lanier earl anderson of san marcos and lyle sendlein of scottsdale chaparral the twotime defending arizona state champion the other ut commitments who have been on some top national lists are ols brett valdez of brownwood and neale tweedie of allen and te david thomas of wolfford frenship janszen said the longhorn coaches told him they want him to play dt and he said they told him they like his quickness and aggressiveness he said when he called texas head coach mack brown to tell him he wanted to play for the longhorns he seemed real happy to hear from me while brown cant talk about specific recruits until they sign he has said he wants defensive linemen who can really run because of all the spread offenses that are the vogue in the big janszen has great explosion at the line of scrimmage and is very fast for a dt he said he picked texas because i liked the way i was treated by the coaches and players they are like a big family after informally visiting all three of his finalists he said ut was an easy choice the players and coaches are so much friendlier than at other places i really felt at home there he alo said his sister lives at new braunfels which is between austin and san antonio her husband is a coach at converse judson he said it will be good to have family that close janszen said he had sacks and about other tackles for losses last year he has a gpa on a scale and has a act score which is well above the qualifying score when i quoted marquis johnsons mother in my last issue as saying he made it to texas but never got to austin it turns out she didnt know the whole story johnson a national top receiver from champaign ill visited with a friend in the dallas area and told me they drove to austin one weekend and looked around but said his mother didnt know that when i talked to her the coaches didnt know i was coming that day and they werent around he said but we looked around a lot and i really liked what i saw austin is a nice town and ive always been a fan of the university of texas football team johnson told me he is very close to committing to texas and probably will take his official visit the august weekend and see the horns september opener against new mexico state he said there is a good chance he will commit during his visit outofstate recruits can take official visits during football season texas recruits have to wait until their seasons are over or under uil rules they would lose their eligibility to finish their high school football season johnson is a great prospect because he is big and fast and doesnt mind making the tough catch in traffic he also has great hands and seldom misses a catchable ball i like to make the catch and get out of trouble as quick as i can he said but i dont mind taking a hit too its a challenge to hang on to the ball when someone is hitting on you there are three bigtime recruits i think the longhorns are almost certain to sign they are johnson dt kasey studdard of highlands ranch colo and dt rodrique wright of alief hastings wright is the top defensive tackle prospect in the country and the best player in texas studdard is one of the top players in colorado and johnson is one of the top recruits in illinois texas also leads with several other top players including lb aaron harris of north mesquite and dt marco martin of mesquite harris is the states top inside linebacker de chase pittman of shreveport evangel the younger brother of cole pittman the sophomore dt at ut who was tragically killed in an automobile accident in february has narrowed his choices to texas and lsu the longhorns have dedicated their second game against north carolina to cole pittman and the pittman family will be in attendance i expect chase pittman to announce his college choice very quicly after that pittman and another nationally recruited de bryan pickryl of jenks okla both plan to graduate in december and enroll in college in january so they can go through spring training pickryl hasnt narrowed his choices to two teams but he has a big three of ucla texas and missouri and the longhorns are at least tied with ucla for the lead at this point oklahoma cant be counted out but he took an unofficial visit to ou about days ago and came home saying the sooners still hadnt moved into his top three his grandmother and two uncles live in austin but his father graduated from ucla hes also an excellent student who wants to go to a very good academic school which probably is a major reason texas ucla and missouri rank ahead of ou my list of the top players in texas includes three players no dt earl anderson no lb brian robison and no ol brett valdez who are already committed to texas the longhorns also are in strong contention for no dt wright no de travis leitko of the woodlands no rb albert hardy of galena park no de larry dibbles of lancaster no ath edorian mccullough of north garland no lb harris no lb garnett smith of arlington lamar no ol justin blalock of plano east no dt martin no cb ricky wilson of port arthur lincoln no de dontriel coates of anahuac and no ath dabryan blanton of carrollton turner wright and hardy both attended ut practices last week there are some other guys in my top who are interested in ut including no qb vincent young of houston madison and no wr robert timmons of flower mound marcus but young seems to be leaning toward going out of state and timmons drew a threegame suspension from his coach last week for unidentified transgressions there are some other great players in the group who have serious academic deficiencies fblb brandon hancock of clovis cal has committed to usc as i noted in my last newsletter he said he enjoyed his unofficial visit to texas but was almost certain he would sign with a california school a national top prospect in california who has expressed some interest in texas is qb trent edwards of los gatos who completed an incredible of his passes last year for yards and tds stanford leads however texas early commitments these are the recruits who already have committed to texas ol brett valdez brownwood dt sonny davis austin lanier and gulf coast miss jc dt earl anderson san marcos dt lyle sendlein scottsdale chaparral ath clint haney smithson valley qb billy don malone paris north lamar wr dustin miksch round rock

performer at the aau junior olympics in norfolk va he broke his own national aau junior olympic record by winning the discus with a throw and was second in the shot and sixth in the javelin future recruiting note john david booty will be the starting qb in the shreveport evangels famed passing offense this year and as a sophomore hes already being featured in national sports magazines and compared favorably with past evangel qbs like brock berlin he has been a visitor at longhorn practices and mentions texas as one of his favorite schools i know he wont be a senior for a long time but write his name in your futures book if you have one because hell be the top recruit in the country in two years unless he gets hurt he already has a powerful arm quick release great accuracy and real speed for a qb and was the top signal caller at the nike camp in baton rouge longhorn notes although the team isnt in full pads yet the oneonone drills between offensive and defensive linemen get pretty fierce at times dt marcus tubbs de kalen thornton and dt maurice gordon have been very impressive getting around and through the blockers and ots mike williams and alfio randall have been the best at keeping the rushers at bay in the drills ive watched the longhorn defense is going to be less predictable this season the team has been working on zone blitzes and other innovative schemes and even has defensive ends dropping off into pass coverage at times we want to disguise what we are doing and try to confuse the quarterback and make him hold on to the ball longer which gives us a better chance to get to him said head coach mack brown senior wr montrell flowers has been one of the stars of the early practices he got behind the secondary and caught two long touchdown passes from qb chris simms in the saturday and sunday workouts the early battles between the receivers and the secondary have been exciting to watch brown says te bo scaife appears to be completely recovered from his knee surgeries bos a valuable part of this football teamm when he is healthy he said and hes looking great hes in the best shape hes been in and he knows hes well now he can help us a lot this

at stanford and many thanks for the lunch we had together i really enjoyed our discussions both at the technical level and otherwise i promised to send you an email regarding possible dates for a visit to enron i delayed it for a week till my schedule was clearer lets see if we can get a match with your schedule mine is rather terrible friday of april looks good but april is easter sunday so that may make it difficult for some people at enron to be around let me know if that is the case i am willing to visit then because the week after that i am scheduled to be in japan and in the previous weeks i am all committed on fridays friday of may is the next possibility but this probably is too far out the main problem is that i am operating within a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this research this window closes by the end of april and it would be important for the student support funds to be in place then so that i can make hard commitments to students and attract top talent i am already reviewing files of students who have approached me for phd advising and i am in a mode of doing soft commitments to starlevel students to get this research and its potential on their radar screen top students are highly sought after by advisors and i want to be an early player in this competition does my visit to enron have to happen before we can set up the project and student support at stanford if so doing it before the end of april is important for getting top people if the visit can happen after we get the ball rolling then we can schedule it in

rejecting their traditional role financial times sec to toughen reports scrutiny financial times march by john labate securities regulators in the us plan to step up their scrutiny of company financial reports in response to changes in economic and corporate conditions the move comes as the securities and exchange commission finds its accounting review resources freed up by the slowdown in filings for initial public offerings that were once the agencys main target last year companies faced a onein chance of being reviewed by sec accountants but the aim this year is to review as many as one in three reports the change could mean companies face tougher inspection on a range of accounting issues that in the past might have gone unnoticed among the issues to get a heightened review are revenue disclosures credit risk reporting hedging techniques and derivatives exposures sec enforcement officials are also expected to raise their surveillance of financial fraud as new trends in manipulation of earnings have begun to emerge annual reports are more likely to be selected for review this year said robert bayless chief accountant at the secs division of corporate finance were returning to the historical norm after a twoyear period of focusing on initial public offering issues in the last five years some of the biggest financial frauds have been uncovered against companies such as cendant and mckesson hboc tens of billions of dollars in market value have been lost as a result sec officials have disclosed that more than financial fraud investigations are under way and that more highprofile cases are likely to be announced soon we are finding more ingenious ways that revenues are being improperly enhanced said charles niemeier chief accountant at the secs division of enforcement another area of investigation involves corporate earnings warnings and how long a company might wait before disclosing news to investors one unnamed company being investigated is said to have waited nine months before revealing a warning few banks could meet new basel rqmts now dow jones march by jonathan nicholson washington federal reserve gov laurence meyer on monday criticized the internal riskassessment capabilities of us banks meyer in prepared remarks to be delivered to a meeting of the institute of international bankers here also said few us banks would qualify now for the relaxed treatment proposed under a new international agreement on how banks are regulated that proposed update to the socalled basel capital accord is expected to be effective in meyers prepared remarks didnt touch on monetary policy or the economic outlook the proposed update to the basel accord was released in january it calls for a threepronged approach to bank regulation involving a new capital standard increased scrutiny of a banks own internal assessment of its capital levels and increased disclosure of risks to the marketplace banks would be allowed to use an internal ratingsbased approach for some capital requirements but meyer said that would only work for banks with good riskmeasuring capabilities as bankers you should ask yourselves whether you are truly ready the quick answer were there is probably wrong meyer said based on our examinations of us banks internal riskrating processes i suspect that few banks would or should get a clean signoff from their supervisor today meyer said banks have been surprisingly slow to link acceptable credit risks and assessments of capital adequacy he said the processes banks use to make internal grades of credit risks are also lacking he said most significantly the rigor and internal consistency of the internal riskrating process is often handicapped by insufficient or unclear rating criteria or by limited resources dedicated to independent reviews of riskrating assignments he said meyer urged banks to comment on the proposal now while it is still undergoing development once adopted by the basel committee on banking supervision it will be submitted to the central banks of the worlds largest economic powers meyer said after that in the us it will go through the usual rulemaking process the proposal may be complex and at times confusing but i believe we are on the right track we need regulatory capital standards that are far more risk sensitive than the one we have now and that provide the industry greater incentives to measure and manage risk he said a ragbag of reform the economist march across europes financial markets lies a colourful patchwork of regulation in austria a government department watches over the markets a task that the irish leave to their central bank the french have two main regulators for their markets while the germans have three with many countries still separating the regulation of banks insurers and securities firms there are about different authorities currently tying up eu member states with red tape these old structures however are changing the british set a brand new example last year when they introduced a single allpowerful regulator the financial services authority to watch over all their financial markets and in february an influential eu group of wise men headed by alexandre lamfalussy a former chairman of the emi forerunner of the european central bank endorsed the british model and recommended a single national regulator for each eu country that led some to wonder whether whats good for britain might be good for europe too would the eu benefit from having a single superregulator the lamfalussy group says that a single authority in each member state would bring economies of scale more streamlined management greater transparency and clearer accountability most eu countries say they are heading towards that goal though so far only denmark and sweden have gone as far as britain belgium luxembourg and finland have merged the supervision of securities and banking but in seven eu countries a separate institution still regulates the securities markets the main motive for reform is clear a broader constituency for each regulator is expected to reduce the inefficiencies in europes fragmented financial markets this fragmentation diminishes the depth and liquidity of the markets and makes the cost of capital in europe persistently higher than it is in america it also makes it more difficult for entrepreneurs to find startup funds per head of population there is five times as much venture capital available in america as there is in europe america has one national regulator for its securities marketsthe securities and exchange commission but it has several regulators for other parts of the financial system the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the federal reserve board and the various state banking commissions all keep an eye on banks while state insurance commissions regulate insurance firms the regime is a mix of monopoly and fragmentation debate on the reform of financial regulation in america has emerged at irregular intervals usually after the shock of a financial scandal whenever something goes seriously wrongthe stock market crash in the collapse of the notorious bank of credit and commerce international or the crash of longterm capital management in reform of financial regulation is hotly debated until now though no evidently superior solution for the regulatory conundrum has prevailed so each country has been left to devise its own system american markets have by and large pioneered those developments in recent years that have made the regulators job much tougherrapid innovation internationalisation and the broadening range of businesses in which individual firms take part but none of these has led to radical reform the american regulatory system has not changed fundamentally since when the sec was set up two heads better than one discussion of regulatory reform in europe has a shorter history most european regulators have not been established for long and change in financial markets has been slower than in america the pressure for reform has accelerated with the recent introduction of the single european currency and with technological progress the euro in effect a single financial market for cash has integrated national bond markets in the euro area and has begun to do the same for equities investment managers now do their research on european bonds and equities by sector rather than by country at the same time changes in technology have replaced many of the old highdecibel trading floors with electronic trading platforms supervising such markets is forcing regulators to rethink their traditional methods of regulation the british government eager to preserve the city of londons leading role in financial services announced a reform of its system of regulation in for years the city had policed itself with selfregulatory organisations that covered both wholesale and retail financial services after a protracted debate about the wisdom of merging all these bodies into one supersupervisor the british parliament finally passed the unwieldy financial services and markets bill last year it is this legislation that established the pioneering fsa the idea of a single regulator is now spreading across europe hans eichel the german finance minister wants to merge his countrys three regulatory bodies into one federal agency for financial market supervision however his plan is unpopular with state governments always sensitive to incursions into their prerogatives at the moment they oversee germanys eight bourses the government of hesse keeps an eye on the frankfurt stock exchange for example while badenwrttemberg watches over the bourse in stuttgart the french too are talking about merging their regulators frances main supervisory authority is the commission des operations de bourse but it shares responsibility with two other bodies the conseil des marchs financiers a self regulatory organisation that oversees market transactions and the commission bancaire the watchdog for the banking industry the french government is a strong proponent of the socalled twin heads model of regulationhaving one regulator for prudential supervision and wholesale business the markets for financial products between professionals and one for the retail markets where financial products are sold to consumers the head of the cob michel prada says that two separate regulatory bodies are preferable to one for two main reasons in the first place they reduce the risk of the retail market regulator being contaminated by its wholesale counterpart and vice versa and secondly they reduce the huge management burden that is imposed on a single regulator the cob has fewer than staff the fsa has around the eus bureaucrats have been pursuing reform for much longer than their national counterpartsand with little to show for it so far in theory eu financial markets were supposed to be one single market from the first day of at the time many of the measures that were required to create a single market in financial services together with more streamlined regulation were put in place restrictions on capital movements had been largely dismantled and the european commission had launched a series of passport directives designed to let banks insurers and stockbrokers offer their services directly across borders without setting up local subsidiaries all was in place for the single market in financial services to take off in practice however member states delayed the implementation of the directives or did not implement the bits that they did not like at first the commission reacted timidly to their recalcitrance setting up a feeble forum of european securities commissions in to promote cooperation among securities regulators fescos work has been inconsequential though largely because it does not have any official status it is further handicapped by being obliged to work by consensus and by being unable to make recommendations that are binding in the aftermath of the launch of the euro europes leaders decided to take more robust action to tackle other financial markets they endorsed the european commissions financial services action plan at their lisbon summit in march a blueprint for integrated capital and financialservices markets across the eu the recommends measures to streamline the regulation of retail and wholesale financial markets the latest deadline for their implementation is not content with this deadline nor with the contents of the plan the french government decided to try both to tinker with it and to speed it up in the second half of last year when france held the presidency of the council of ministers laurent fabius the french finance minister suggested setting up a small committee to study the possibility of a more radical plan in it he wanted to include the establishment of a paneuropean regulator to be headquartered in paris britain was staunchly opposed to the setting up of such a committee and tried unsuccessfully to block it to calm britains worries a british treasury official sir nigel wicks was made a member of the committee that was eventually formed under mr lamfalussys chairmanship it produced an interim report last november and a final report in midfebruary competing visions despite all this activity neither national governments nor policymakers in brussels have made up their minds about the best form of financial regulation for europe most eu member states now consider a single supervisor for all financial services to be the best solution within their own domain although there are those who want to keep regulation of the wholesale market apart from regulation of the retail side by the same token a paneuropean regulator would seem to be the most efficient way to put an end to europes regulatory ragbag yet the idea of competition between different jurisdictions offering their own brand of regulation has its supporters while the french campaign for a single european regulator britains chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown is fiercely opposed to the idea the germans are also in favour of a paneuropean regulator though they are less keen than the french caio kochweser a state secretary at the german finance ministry has said that at some stage a paneuropean regulator will be on the agenda by reforming its regulatory setup his country is to foreshadow that development mr lamfalussys group stops short of proposing a single regulator or even twin heads for the whole of the eualthough its recommended creation of a securities committee to speed up the eus cumbersome legislative procedures has been seen by some as an embryonic sec this is an openended process says mr lamfalussy his committees report has only proposed measures that it thinks can be implemented in the next few years mr lamfalussy is he concedes a federalistbut a pragmatic one his group was not asked to come up with a counterproposal to the commissions fsap rather it was expected to highlight the most urgent measures needed to streamline the regulation of securities markets in the eu hence the groups final report focuses on the modernisation of rules for investment and pension funds on the adoption of international accounting standards and on a single passport for stockmarkets mr lamfalussy wants all these reforms implemented by although he admits it will be tricky other priorities on the list are less controversiala single prospectus for issuers the principle of mutual recognition for wholesale markets and the modernisation of exchanges listing requirements ironically many of the groups recommendations have been under discussion for years or are in some cases already part of an eu directive many of these proposals however came out halfbaked the key investmentservices directive for instance which sets conditions for a single euwide license for investment firms and which empowers stock exchanges to operate across borders was watered down and implemented belatedly although the directive was approved in many governments waited until to implement it in order to get it approved at all the commission had to tolerate many ambiguities in the text for instance something as basic as the definition of a professional investor is unclear mr lamfalussy makes much of the damage that has been done by the delays in tack ling what he calls priority measures national governments still stick to protectionist investment rules for investment and pension funds for example the italian government requires that pension funds invest a considerable portion of the money that they manage in government bonds and multi national companies are obliged to run a different pension plan for their employees in each member state of the union as a result the average american investment fund is six times bigger than its european equivalent and between and the average real return on pension funds was in america and in eu countries that impose strict restrictions the people who suffer most from europes protectionist rules are pensioners themselves and as more and more of them come to rely on privatesector schemes their loss will be even greater mr lamfalussy is also concerned about the damage that is being done by the continuing failure of most eu member countries to introduce rules on disclosure comparable to american standards this failure means that investors in the eu are not properly protected for instance information on the stock options granted to the directors of lernout hauspie a troubled belgian company developing speechrecognition technology could only be found at the secs edgar an electronic register in america that gathers and analyses data on companies flies even the belgian authorities that are investigating lernout for allegedly inventing revenues had to turn to the sec for help karel lannoo at the centre for european policy studies in brussels is among those in favour of introducing a european edgar once the single european prospectus is a reality and once eu accounting standards are more homogeneous almost stronger than the lamfalussy committees desire to give new impetus to proposals for reform that in many cases have been discussed for years is its desire to accelerate decisionmaking procedures within the eu and to control more tightly the implementation of directives by member states at present the commission makes a legislative proposal to the council of ministers and the european parliament they then shunt it around in a complex codecision procedure that takes on average more than two years the takeover directive has been in the works for years and has still not been adopted while the european company statute has been discussed on and off for more than years mr lamfalussy calls for a fourlevel approach to decisionmaking and the implementation of financialmarket proposals at the first level the council of ministers the european commission and the european parliament would agree on framework legislation and would decide which of the measures to be implemented should be passed to the next level at this second level a newly created securities committee made up of representatives of the commission and of member states would reach agreement within three months on the technicalities of the new legislation this they would do after consulting market participants and consumers the government representatives on the securities committee should be just under the finance minister says mr lamfalussy predictably the idea of such a committee has aroused the wrath of the european parliament it worries that the committee will be come a means for removing important decisions from democratic accountability levels three and four of the lamfalussy approach to decisionmaking involve cooperation among national regulators via a regulators committee its purpose will be to improve the implementation of eu legislation by the better enforcement of eu rules the timetable for the lamfalussy plan is ambitious it is to be debated by the european parliament in midmarch where it is unlikely to have a comfortable ride and it will then come before the european council at its meeting in stockholm at the end of march there the list of priorities in the plan is due to get the communitys stamp of approval the commission is then to begin setting up the securities committee and the regulators committee in april and may and by december the two committees should be in operation all mr lamfalussys recommendations are due to be implemented by a year earlier than the deadline of the commissions own action plan this is ambitious even if mr lamfalussys fourlevel approach is simpler than the kafkaesque co decision procedure currently in place it is still a complicated structure moreover some of the measures on his priority list such as the move to international accounting standards are very likely to take more than two years to implement the role of the regulator the debate about financialmarket regulation in europe has moved from considering the merits of selfregulation versus statutory regulation to whether a single regulator should police all financial services the lamfalussy report has done nothing to help resolve this dilemma financial regulation exists for three main reasons it is there to provide a safety net that will prevent the collapse of one bank insurer or investment manager triggering the failure of others it is also there to supervise the integrity of financial institutions and to protect individual consumers from malpractice and fraud and it is there to act as the watchdog of financial markets policing insider dealing malpractice and other offences if it is tricky for a single national authority to combine these different objectives of regulation it is even harder for a supranational regulator how can a single organisation hope to protect investors police financial institutions and watch markets in different jurisdictions even if it were desirable to try some form of common jurisdiction would be essential on top of everything else a regulator has to be firm and effective to gain credibility if the eus track record in enforcing its directives on financial regulation is anything to go by a pan european regulator would be neither no taste for risk are markets rejecting their traditional role financial times march by philip coggan the collapse of barings the asian financial crisis of the dotcom mania of these events have created the idea that the financial markets are a frankensteins monster wreaking havoc on the societies that created them not so according to the author of this polemic far from being a giant casino the financial system has become obsessed with controlling risk at the expense of fulfilling its proper function providing capital for business as a consequence the era of financial growth has coincided with that of a secular economic slowdown this is at the very least a refreshingly different take on the events of the past years the world in the authors view has too few risktakers not too many and mr benami assembles some solid building blocks for his case he points out quite rightly that equity markets have been taken over by fund managers who are obsessed with the business risk of matching the index and their peers rather than achieving the maximum return banks have retreated from their function of providing risk capital to business in favour of the feeearning function of arranging bond issues the rise of the derivatives industry illustrates the extent to which companies and financial professionals have become obsessed with the aim of avoiding risk whether it comes in the form of interest rate and currency movements or changes in the weather benami also points out that in the us and the uk at least stock markets have almost ceased to perform the function of providing capital to business in net terms capital has been returned to investors in the form of takeovers and share buybacks but just when you feel mr benami has the basis of a good case nagging doubts start to enter your mind how is he going to deal with the rise of the venture capital industry or with the use of share options to motivate executives or with the growth of day trading the answer is that he doesnt really address those issues in fact the case that the financial system is starving industry of funds has been made at various times over the last century but it has been extremely difficult to prove it seems a particularly ropey argument when one considers the events of the last decade arguably the financial system was ludicrously keen to fund anyone with a laptop and a new economy idea the economy may now face a crisis of overinvestment there has been no shortage of funds for startups the amount of money invested by us venture capital groups rose from dollars in to dollars in and established groups have had no problems raising capital either international bond issuance in reached a record high of dollars arguably the decline of government bond issuance thanks to the improved finances of european and us governments has freed capital for industry it is also pretty hard to argue that risktaking in society has declined when one recalls how many executives and employees have left established companies for dotcom startups over the last couple of years old economy businesses have also been happy to gear up taking on extra debt either through management buyouts or to increase the return on equity and satisfy the stock market individuals have also been happy to take on greater debt in the uk and the us and to put a greater proportion of savings into equities albeit via collective schemes such as mutual funds neither development suggests a riskaverse culture and while enthusiasm for developments such as online trading and spread betting may be confined to a small minority it still points to the existence of a strong gambling mentality arguably the long bull market has blinded investors to the risks inherent in equity investment rather than making them too cautious it is also pretty hard looking at the record of the us over the last five years to say that economic growth has been sluggish one can argue about some of the productivity statistics and about the causes of the improvement but the us has nevertheless grown faster at a lower unemployment level and with scarcely any inflationary pressure than most economists would have thought possible a few years ago mr benamis case might make more sense applied to europe or the uk but the us is at the heart of financial market change if this thesis doesnt work there it doesnt work at all in short the author makes a much better case for the defence of the financial system than he does when attacking its pusillanimity"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody",

reports from the november print edition lay of the land pundits see enron ceo as top contender for bush energy czar monica perin enron corp ceo ken lays name is buzzing around houston as a possible secretary of energy in a bush administration if george w bush ultimately emerges victorious in the florida brouhaha lay held a post in the department of energy early in his career and has long been a frequent flyer to the nations capital to testify lobby and consult with federal officials on energy issues lay was also considered a candidate for a cabinet position in the previous bush administration when former president george bush named his commerce secretary houstonian robert mosbacher as general chairman of his reelection campaign in december of lay was on the list of possible successors to mosbacher as of last week lay was maintaining that no one from either presidential camp had talked to him about any cabinet positions he says he doesnt have any interest in going back to washington hes already been there and done that says enron spokesman mark palmer although he adds that lay has left himself some wiggle room another houstonian bill white ceo of wedge international served as deputy secretary of energy from to in the clintongore administration white believes that if the senior bush had been reelected in lay would likely have been appointed to a position in that administration it would be a great fit for ken white says of the energy secretary role ron oligny a houston oil industry consultant and author has also heard the lay rumors and finds it difficult to see him walk away from such an opportunity he has demonstrated the ability to create an atmosphere in which new and positive things can happen in the energy sector so he would be a valid choice oligny says he certainly understands the transition that is going on in the energy market john sodergreen editor and publisher of several online trade publications in the energy commodities trading sector also sees lay as a likely candidate the marylandbased industry watcher points out that bush has mentioned lay in several speeches and lay has made big contributions to bushs campaign sodergreen believes lay would not turn down an offer that would be very bad for enron he couldnt do that besides he doesnt need more money says sodergreen lay and his wife linda were the biggest individual texas contributors of soft money in the elections giving a total of with percent going to republican candidates according to figures compiled by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics enron corp also topped the list of corporate soft money donors in texas with a total of to democrats and to republicans houston energy analyst matthew simmons of simmons co international takes a dissident view he doesnt think lay would take the job of energy secretary he would have eight or years ago but not now he says simmons says he has lobbied hard for the secretary of energy appointee in a bush administration to be a democrat its a key appointment and it needs to be bipartisan he says weve so demagogued energy in the campaign you have to reach across the aisle simmons says he has proposed either bennett johnston a retired senior senator from louisiana and a longtime senate energy committee member or david boren retired oklahoma senator and the other energy giant in congress both are

not tried to provide detailed drafting comments but there are many many problems with the draft i have limited my comments to what i consider the bigger issues some of my comments may have already been addressed by andy but since i am starting fresh on this i thought that i would just comment on everything i look forward to talking with you further about this which is the correct enron entity i assume that this should be an agreement with enron networks does accenture expect a parent guaranty does accenture expect a broader exclusivity that binds enron corp and its affiliates i assume that we want to limit the scope of the exclusivity to enron networks the description of enrononline is much too broad various goods and raw materials this needs to be limited to certain products i dont understand why accenture is licensing aggregate data i thought the service to be established was to provide reformatted data to individual enron customers that would require only customerspecific data will enron be receive real time data transfers will this be true in the sense that it will be the same time as enron transmits information to the customer i assume that there may be a lag in time between the completion of a transaction and the transmission of the transaction data in section the scope of the exclusive license needs to be carefully thought through and narrowed as much as possible what is posttransaction data and why does accenture needwant an exclusive license on aggregate data also regarding the exclusive license we need to consider all necessary exceptions to the exclusivity such as enrons internal use transmission to the customer etc also all transmissions of customerspecific data require the customers prior consent the exclusivity should apply only if that consent is obtained by accenture and only for as long as that consent is valid one key aspect of an exclusive license is how it is terminated normally there are increasing minimum royalties associated with the licensees continued exclusive rights often the licensee has the right not to pay the minimum royalties in which case the license can convert to a nonexclusive or the license can terminate in section there is a reference to accentures right to sublicense this right needs to be carefully narrowed and clearly stated can accenture remarket the data to anyone other than the customer the term customer is confusing in section it would seem to relate only to enrononline customers but later in that section it speaks of its customers in the definition schedule the term is not limited to enrononlines customers in section the same comments in points apply to the exclusive license of the software there is a reference in section to updates and revisions will enron be responsible for these what continuing services will enron be obligated to offer for the software will enron be entitled to receive and use any improvements or updates that accenture may make to the software should the scope of the license be limited geographically why is it worldwide if it is worldwide what happens if accenture does not market in some countries is enron excluded from using or licensing the data in those countries in section i assume that enron will dictate the format of the data to be received and that enron may revised that format from time to time section has some language that says that enron will provide the interface between accenture and enron and any other software developed by or on behalf of enron necessary for accenture to perform its obligations to its customers that is ridiculously broad what obligations to accentures customers i cant imagine that enron would give accenture additional software for free especially if enron spent considerable amounts developing it additional software may require additional license fees etc the concept of service levels and service level credits is typical in service agreements i wonder what accenture has in mind they certainly resist any meaningful service levels or credits when they are providing service section is truly amazing it is so broad that accenture could argue that anything enron does adversely affects accenture and that enron has to pay accenture if enron is willing to provide accenture with a noncompete in addition to the exclusive license then these provisions need to be harmonized and carefully limited perhaps accenture thought that this provision was for the benefit of enron in that it enables enron to complete potentially competitive transactions without violating the exclusivity license we need to discuss the business points that accenture is trying to address in this section and start again with the drafting section is yet another twist on exclusivity this also needs to be tied into the scope of the exclusivity provisions if an enron customer hates accenture and refuses to do business with them then what happens can enron provide the service to that customer if so what is the effect of the exclusive right in section section also contains a reference to cobranding marketing activities and requires enron to support and assist accenture this is much too broad enron may or may not wish to engage in cobranding marketing activities and if so they need to be narrowly defined at the time the exception in section to enrons provision of the data services is very troubling as it would appear that accenture is trying to limit enrons discretion in establishing its own pricing if accenture really wants this type of protection we need to review it with antitrust counsel the payment terms seem extraordinarily generous for accenture it would be highly unusual in my experience to have license fees paid only once per year not that i would know but the minimum payments seem very low to me the minimum payments is the best way to establish whether accenture has met its obligations to market etc so that it can keep its exclusive rights i would think that the minimum fees would be significantly higher they could be indexed to the number of transactions customers or transaction value of enrononline so that if enrononline grew faster than expected accenture would have to keep pace or loose its exclusivity the use of gross tsh revenues as part of the formula for royalties is typical but it presents a very significant challenge because accenture will have other relationships with its customers and may under price this service and try to make their money on consulting services it would be better for enron if we could come up with a transaction fee that accenture would have to pay enron for each transactiontransmission of data to a customer and then let accenture worry about how it makes money we need to consider the tax issues further i think that the fees paid to enron for data transmissionresale and for the software may be subject to state sales tax accenture should be responsible for at least the taxes related to the data transmissionresale if it is reselling these services to its customers it can provide enron with a resale exemption certificate the license of software is probably not subject to the same exemption and may be taxable in any event that would require us to split the revenue stream between the two types of services or run the risk that the whole stream is taxable regardless of the resale certificate we need to consider these issues further with tax counsel the term is another amazing provision first five years is a very long time in my view to have an exclusive license for this type of newevolving business second accentures proposal for a unilateral option to extend it for five more years is a bold move but it seems ridiculous to me that the minimum annual payments for those additional years would be fixed at million surely they jest enron needs a way to terminate this license early either through a buyout right or a termination for convenience with a payment also if accenture is violating the terms of the license or otherwise violating material terms of this agreement enron should have the right to terminate i have often used the approach that the licensor should not be permitted to terminate except in the event of a payment default but we should seek much more especially if enron only gets paid once a year i noticed that accenture did not offer any representations some would be appropriate the liabilityindemnity section is interesting in that it lacks any indemnity by accenture to enrons benefit i would think that accenture would indemnify enron for all claims by customers relating to accentures service except if directly related to enrons error we need to discuss this risk model we have to assume that enrononlines customers would come after both accenture and enrononline and we need to consider how these claims should be handled the limits of liability are interesting i wonder what the story is behind the million limit for us and the million limit for them we would not accept the exclusions to the consequential damages as drafted and we would want to exclude claims related to accentures breach of enrons ip rights from any consequential damage limitation the worldwide license provisions of section require some discussion i doubt that enron intends to get consents for and make all filings in countries where accenture wants to sell these services see you on

on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the administration to the pm on his visit this week while opic certainly does not have final say re the message on dabhol they are clearly the driver within the usg and they have been very aggressive in that regard out of our meeting watson sent to state and the nsc a message with the following two points the project sponsors the lenders and opic and exim are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on dabhol is approaching its end if india does not act immediately it will be too late the president and this administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the goi to make an effort to engage on the buyout which needs to be negotiated within a particular range subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the lenders the opic memo was sent to state and the nsc and is now embodied in talking points for president bush in his friday meeting with the pm for the last week plus i have provided daily updates to opic to larsons office at state to the south asia regional group and to the nsc so they know of any new developments and where we are yesterday afternoon i met with opic on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points at this point president bush will raise dabhol in his meeting with the pm friday the indian ambassador met with the nsc yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the mou going in it is being considered that larry lindsey will discuss dabhol in greater detail probably with mishra there was some concern about prior relationship to enron but i understand from state the lawyers have taken care of the concern larson is in doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary it is unfortunate he is out of town amb

indian embassy i do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend if jim is out as i understand he is perhaps rob walls and i can attend this meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the washington context to the proposal that i understand is in the offing in singapore we will then be in a position to feed that information back into the usg so that the presidents

some thoughts after reflecting on what i understand to be jans rating at yesterdays fun ctional prc first i have no issue with the criticism of his behaviours a nd interpersonal skills i have sent him several notes of coachingadmonis hment when he copied me on emails that were too strongly worded while so me account should be taken of his being bavarian i do not think that is an excuse or cover for what is clearly an area for improvement having sai d that i would add the following this is his first rating with the company i think after the month s he has just turned in i think a rating of which is what i understand he got is going to be a bit demoralising in additon people rarely move up two notches between periods if he is rated a and fixes his behaviou rs there is no doubt he would be a at yearend if he continued to perfo rm substantively as he has if he is rated now and continues to behave as he has he can go down to a and suffer the financial penalties associ ated with that jan has had a halfyear of results that most people hope for he fixed a number of erroneous license applications initiated by donald lassere and in so doing secured licenses for ebs europe in germany france belgium t he netherlands and spain i think and i think all or most were from about middecember onwards big win after much toing and froing jan not tax not legal not ou tside counsel not accounting came up with the business structure for trad ing bandwidth in the far east the first deal done there before jans app roach required contracts with multiple entities it may now seem obviou s but jan came up with the idea that each of the national telcos trades i n its own name across borders securing licenses in the name of the same e ntity in each country so why not ebs asia this was a huge breakthrough f or ebs asia jan helped secure the pioneer tax status zero corporate tax for at leas t years maybe ten in singapore thus helping to secure singapore as our asian location of choice along w ith the big success noted in my item below jan secured the necessary clarifications on the license fee assessed in singapore to make singapore our location and ebs asia licensed in singapo re our vehicle for asian bandwidth trading there was initially a clear and justified concern that we would be charged on gross turnover this has now been reduced to of the fees associated with singapore traffic p hysical not financial only the repeated exchanges between jan tax way ne gardner and fred cohagan did get snippy so i would not be surprised i f this elicited bad feedback my explanation is that jan a sked for final issuesquestions several times and after each clarificati on from singapore regulator he got a barrage of questions internally and had to go back to ida some of the questions were legitimate some s hould have been thought of earlier so jans frustration was partly underst andable partly not second i think jan got all the clarification he coul d in a farely opaque regulatory regime at least on the license fee questio n remember ida was not too sure what we were up to and what they were op ining on i think jan and me recognised that regulation is not always a s transparent in europe and asia as in the us conversely you had a trade r who i think has not had a big trading responsibility before and he was seeking transparancy that simply was not going to happen jan told him so again after a few tries perhaps too abruptly as a team player jan made the effort to support the asian effort long hard travel including going out to interview the ebs regulatory affairs candidates we ended up with two qualified candidates even if we have now chosen to go with yet anotherthird candidate his willingness to helpbe a team player seems completely overlooked in focussing on his other behavi ours finally jans biggest problem is also his biggest asset there is no doubt in my mind that he knows more about the telecomms industry technical ly as well as the substance of regulation than anyone else in the company he does not suffer those who know less than him very easily this is wro ng and needs to be addressed but i am concerned that he is effectively be ing taken down two notches for his interpersonal skills it seems the mess age we are sending is that we are in effect valuing good interpersonal sk ills over results a commercial person who has a big year but acts out of line would not get a rating below acceptable for being abrasive it seems to me too harsh to rate jan below acceptable for being abrasive if we also consider his bavarian background and as i have shared with rick the fact that jan got a heightened sense of urgen cy from jim fallon that i think made jan think his behaviour was ac ceptable if all that mattered was getting results

of them and the rest of us could have fun one night even though dad is doing so much better you never know when you will have the chance to get everyone together on a trip like this memorymaker or nightmare could be a toss up but maybe worth the try lets share some research and see if there is any place that we could get excited about going"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody", "pk": 869, "fields": {"body_text": "after reading this article for a detailed discussion of writing options on the s listen to michael pinsons interview of james cordier on the market mavens radio show from january click here high percentage trading on the s by james cordier michael gross liberty trading group from marketmavenscom january with the volatility and higher option premiums the s can be an ideal market for the properly capitalized trader to write option premium for increased returns as we all know this is the king of the futures markets and thus deserves the respect of the option writer for this reason we only participate in the most conservative of trades when dealing with this contract option sellers like to sleep at night that being said the rewards can still be very attractive while we do not pretend to know what the stock market is going to do we cannot help but get caught up in the positive outlook for barring another catastrophic terrorist attack we find it hard to imagine any reason the stock market would go below the lows set back in september for that reason we recommend the following simple high probability strategy which if successful will yield about a return within months instead of trying to pick individual stocks or trying to guess what the s will do tomorrow or next week a trader takes an alternate way out at the time of this writing the june s is trading at about a trader can sell a june s put option and collect about for every option sold the margin to do this is around per option at this time for the option to go in the money the june s would have to fall over points before june that is a full points below the low established in the wake of september if the market moves higher from here it should be an easy ride as the option deteriorates and expires worthless and the option seller keeps the money if the market stays steady the option expires worthless the option seller keeps the money if the market falls but stays above the option expires worthless the option seller keeps the money only if the market is below at expiration does the seller have a loss however before you run out and liquidate the retirement account lets take a look at the downside possibilities of the trade first of all this trade is only recommended for the comfortably capitalized account a drop of or even points in the s would still not put your option in the money but it may temporarily increase the value of your option and thus also your margin requirement a trader should have adequate back up capital in his account if he intends to ride out such an occurrence the other risk of course would be the futures being below at option expiration which makes the trader long the june s at not necessarily a bad thing however if the market continues to fall down past and the trader continues to hold his position losses could be substantial stock traders considering this strategy should ask themselves the following question what type of return do i hope to make on my stock portfolio by june of this year is it close to what type of losses would i incur in my stock portfolio if the s fell to in the option trade you still make in a move below the odds are good for a lot of traders that the losses they would incur in their stock portfolio would be much greater than being short the s at in other words we think this is a good way to trade the stock market as we said in the beginning we dont know what the stock market is going to do but from a risk standpoint we like being long from if you would like to discuss trading this way for your account

to calgary is the right thing to do as you recall we have been down the road of improving the service to calgary previously this seems to work in the short term but as soon as there is turnover in the group which unfortunately seems to occurs regularly the service level starts to drop i would like you to consider the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to calgary when you meet with mark first when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial confirmations to calgary mark taylors concern was our legal staff at that time we had one attorney who did not have expertise in the financial area we now have three very competent attorneys greg johnston has spent time in houston and has recently attended an isda training course second there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by houston and with the process itself at the time of the project doorstep audit we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent out after we had approved them as you saw from my memo confirmations are periodically sent out without our review also we have found mistakes in the confirmations themselves including the contract date referred to in the confirmation the first two issues cause me a lot of concern some of the confirmations sent out without our review were wrong which is a big problem we had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out which is even a bigger problem third there is no real additional control in the process by having houston generate the confirmations if you think about what the process is the transactions are done in calgary we fax the deal sheets to houston the confirmation is generated using a template that has been preapproved by legal we review and approve the confirmation and execute them online if done by enron canada corp or send an email if the enron entity is enron north america houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty if the counterparty is a trading company houston follows up on the status of execution for all other entities the calgary office is now doing the followup all these transactions are currently settled out of the calgary office if the transactions were done in calgary we would be using the same preapproved templates that houston is using it is not clear to me where there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in houston or conversely why there is any additional risk in having calgary prepare our own financial confirmations if there is some perception that an element of risk exists by having calgary prepare the financial confirmations why are we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations fourth there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in houston while the review process is done in calgary currently houston has staff handling the calgary transactions because the confirmations are reviewed and approved here i have similar staff who print the confirmations route them for review update tagg notify houston when the review is complete and then followup with either houston or the counterparty on issues or execution we are currently following up on all nontrading company financial confirmations so we are both printing and reviewing the transactions following up with the counterparties and filing these documents as i stated before calgary could assume full responsibility for the financial confirmations without adding any staff fifth there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in houston because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth the confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within hours of the transaction being done we feel this time line could be met if we did the financial confirmations here this reduces risk for enron finally because we are a small office i need the opportunity to develop my existing employees so that they dont feel that they need to leave the company in order to broaden their knowledge base given the skill sets of the documentation group it is difficult for them to move into other areas such as risk logistics or accounting so it is important that i am able to keep them challenged within the documentation group because we review the confirmations the basic understanding of the financial transactions already exists however i know that my employees would appreciate having full accountability and responsibility for this function and have the opportunity to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations as a final note i report to you i am fully accountable to you for ensuring that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function properly it would mean a lot to me as well as the documentation staff to get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this function to calgary mark taylor has never met me or my staff yet i get the impression that he doesnt think we are capable of handling this function i hope that you will be able to set him straight on this he just needs to look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that exists here if you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in this memo please let me know as you can see the calgary office feels very strongly about this issue including rob milthorp and peter keohane please let me know how your meeting with mark goes thanks peggy enron north america corp from sally beck pm to peggy hedstromcalectect cc subject re financial confirm i got your message and i have asked brent to get with me when he is back in the office on friday together we will do two things devise a foolproof plan to insure an excellent level of service to calgary

creditors they could as one consumer advocate says cannibalize each other in competing for pgs assets though pg says creditors will all b e paid in full it hasnt said how long that will take pg corp the utilitys parent it might be forced to infuse the utility with cash pg also could sue energy wholesalers to recoup overcharges or could sell off its own power generators to raise cash until last week when montali made it known that he wont raise retail rate s the two major players in the bankruptcy proceedings the utility and the official creditors committee had agreed on most matters that came up in court including the need for a rate increase now its going to get maybe a little uglier and less friendly predicts jesse fried a bankruptcy law professor at the university of california berkeley it looks like theyre just going to have to sit down and decide whos going to eat the loss fried says the right answer should be pg corp which requested deregulation of the energy market and profited from it until soaring wholesale prices left the utility subsidiary with massive debt in part because retail rates were frozen between the time deregulation was passed and the end of the utility transferred billion to its parent corporation before filing for bankruptcy protection april according to a stateordered audit to force the corporation to repay the money says sacramento

pay creditors and repay the state for electricity it has purchased on the wholesale marke t at a meeting thursday between the utility and some of its creditors pg chief financial officer kent harvey said the utilitys hydroelectric facilities are worth between billion and billion james lopes th e utilitys bankruptcy lawyer declared the subject of a possible sale off limits at the meeting rosenfield predicts it will remain off limits because he says the state would begin talking about seizing the generators rather than risk a sale to an outofstate buyer he favors another option suing the outofstate companies that have been charging the highest wholesale energy rates if i were the small business that supplies pencils and paper clips to pg i would want to collect some money from the energy companies that overcharg ed pg for power until the state stepped in to buy the power in the utilitys place he said if pg filed an antitrust case against those companies it could be tried in bankruptcy court according to cooper discussion on that subject also was ruled off limits by lopes however harvey said the utility has requested a probe by the federal energ y regulatory commission

to just so you get the right lingo trutta is the name of the ena subsidiary where these assets now have a home ena under a servicing agreement is the servicer of the assets i am attaching for your

at least that i know of a number of these assets also have raptor hedges in place in addition to being in the velocity structure only the portion of the investment that was on enas balance sheet was hedged if an asset is sold that has been raptorized the swap will need to be promptly terminatednotional amounts adjusted etc again give us as much notice as you can we also need notice of any follow on investments in the same merchant assets exchanges of our interest or further fundings because stuff will have to be done i will not bore you with the details but this stuff cannot be done in one

essential identity then god said let us make man in our image according to our likeness adam was created physically and spiritually alive he possessed eternal life from his first breath and enjoyed gods abiding presence in the garden of eden furthermore unlike the animal kingdom that operated by divine instinct adam was created in the likeness of god with a mind emotions and will giving him the ability to think feel and choose no other created being can make that claim after creating adam god said it is not good for the man to be alone so he created a suitable helper for him eve they both enjoyed a sense of belonging to god and each other not only that god gave them a purpose to rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth adam and eve didnt have to search for significance they had it in their relationship with god and because god was present with them they lived in perpetual safety and security eternal life identity purpose significance security and a sense of belonging are all attributes of mankind created in the image of god adam and eve experienced these attributes in full measure and we were destined to enjoy them too but when adam sinned he died spiritually and forfeited everything god had provided being separated from god adams glowing attributes became glaring needs as children of adam born separated from god we come into the world with these same glaring needs we wander though life striving to make a name of ourselves looking for security in temporal things and searching for significance apart from god is it a hopeless quest no we are able to fulfill these needs by establishing a personal relationship with god through faith in jesus christ everything adam enjoyed in the garden before he sinned is now at our disposal loving heavenly father thank you for sending jesus to die for my sin so i may have eternal life and thank you that in christ my need for identity significance security and a

strangest thing ive ever heard the series of events that had to have taken place in order for this to happen are astounding at the annual awards dinner given for forensic science aafs president dr don harper mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death on march the medical examiner viewed the body of ronald opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head mr opus had jumped from the top of a tenstory building intending to commit suicide he left a note to that effect indicating his despondency as he fell past the ninth floor his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killed him instantly neither the shooter nor the dead man was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that ronald opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he planned ordinarily dr mills continued a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds even though the mechanism might not be what he intended is still defined as committing suicide that mr opus was shot during what would apparently have been an unsuccessful suicide attempt because of the safety net caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands the room on the ninth floor where the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife they were arguing vigorously and he was threatening her with a shotgun the man was so upset when he pulled the trigger that he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking mr opus as he passed by outside when someone intending to kill person a kills person b instead someone is still guilty of murder when confronted with a murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant they both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded the old man said it was his longstanding habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun he had no intention to murder her therefore the killing of mr opus appeared to be an accident that is the gun had been accidentally loaded the continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couples son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident it transpired that the old lady had cut off her sons financial support and the son knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother the case now reverts back to one of murder on the part of the son now comes the final twist further investigation revealed that the couples son was in fact ronald opus he had become increasingly despondent over his failed attempt to engineer his mothers murder this led him to jump off the tenstory building on march only to be killed by the shotgun blast passing through the ninth floor window the son had actually murdered himself so the medical examiner closed the case and declared it a suicide"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody", "pk": 1178, "fields": {"body_text": "mike i am totally booked today and am physically out of our office most of the day cathy has attempted to coordinate and

been made possible due to a unique set of circumstances involving electric industry restructuring which has proceeded in accordance with california state law ab required sdg to lower electric rates by for residential and small commercial customers then froze rate levels for up to years ab also allowed sdg to issue rate reduction bonds to finance the rate reduction in sdg issued rate reduction bonds

its two san diego power plants at higher than expected prices and through numerous other actions that combination of factors and the benefits of the rate reduction bonds mean sdg is able to distribute about million to its customers the bonds cannot be paid off early so the current trust transfer amount line item on the sdg bill which pays for the bonds will continue for the bond life an important point to clarify is that the money being distributed does not represent overcollections from prior years customers have benefited from many of the changes brought about by electric industry restructuring these include the electric rate reduction the electric rate freeze and the monthly trust transfer amount credit the trust transfer amount is the charge that pays for the rate reduction

candidates who were not up to the requirements of their job and used jeff skilling as an example i have agreed with views of this journalist for some time especially since jeff called a fund manager an asshole publically calling someone is simply not something any ceo should do and you and enrons board should have done something about jeff then my point is as follows where were you and the enron

"fields": {"body_text": "isda press report october credit derivatives documentation into the future fow the direction for derivatives fow documentation into the future fow october by alessandro cocco and joe kohler credit derivatives are instruments used for buying or selling the risk that an obligor defaults on one or more specific obligations in this article we will examine the foundation stone that underpins the vast majority of credit derivative documentation the isda credit derivatives definitions pointing out some of the documentations key features and where they have already been refined the definitions are a set of contractual provisions that can be incorporated by reference into confirmations relating to credit derivatives that take the form of single name default swaps this allows parties to a transaction to use a short form of confirmation containing only the economic and dealspecific terms relating to that transaction the objective of this structure is to provide market participants with a tool for producing documentation that is sufficiently sophisticated to deal with the majority of issues arising from such transactions simple enough to facilitate rapid processing and cost effective the definitions achieve this by codifying market practices but more importantly the prospect of their generation helped to focus minds on establishing some of these practices in the first place as with all isda documentation the definitions allow for numerous elections to be made by the parties and the parties are also free to make whatever amendments or additions they agree by inclusion in the confirmation of appropriate language the definitions also provide for a number of fallbacks to apply in case the parties do not specify otherwise market participants recognise the particularly important role of documentation in the credit derivatives market as a consequence of the russian and asian financial crises it became clear that in the case of credit derivatives more than for other derivative transactions the payment of large sums of money may depend on the interpretation of the wording of a specific clause the isda credit derivatives definitions scope the definitions apply to credit default swaps relating to obligations for the payment of money by a reference entitywith appropriate modifications the definitions can also be used to document credit derivative transactions that refer to baskets of reference entities or to form the basis of documents relating to funded products in a transaction the party buying credit risk protection or buyer undertakes to pay the seller of protection a predetermined amount in return the seller undertakes to make a payment in favour of the buyer in case the defined credit events occur credit events serve as indicators of the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the reference entity one of the main characteristics of a credit derivative is that the buyer does not have to suffer a loss as a result of a credit event in order to qualify for the payment from the seller for example a buys from b the right to receive from b a payment of in case company x is subject to bankruptcy proceedings or does not repay loan y if company x undergoes bankruptcy proceedings or loan y is not repaid a credit event occurs the occurrence of one of these events in circumstances involving the satisfaction of any other condition to payment that the parties may have specified in the transaction would give a the right to receive from b the agreed payment irrespective of whether a had any credit exposure to company x or loan y this feature is of crucial importance to the determination of the regulatory environment applicable to credit derivatives in the uk if entering into credit derivatives transactions constituted the carrying on of insurance business there would be a requirement for authorisation under the insurance companies act the fact that a buyer of a credit derivative does not have to hold the obligations in question in order to obtain a payment from the seller means that the credit derivative does not fall within the scope of this legislation this analysis was set out in full in a legal opinion obtained by isda in reference entity it is essential that the reference entity is identified with sufficient precision for example to what extent are successors or affiliates of an entity to be included this point is particularly important when dealing with a sovereignwhat if any governmental agencies or authorities should be included within this definition the demerger of national power last year led to further debate surrounding the definition of successor national power shifted a large number of obligations to a new company called innogy following the demerger innogy became a stronger credit than national power had been beforehand and national power in its new guise became weaker as a consequence buyers and sellers of credit protection in relation to national power had opposing views from a commercial perspective at least as to which was the successor isda is now looking into further refinements to the concept of successor credit events the buyer and seller may buy and sell credit risk defined by reference to different types of credit events it is appropriate that both select carefully the type of event on which they wish to trade the definitions offer a menu that comprises failure to pay acceleration or default repudiationmoratorium restructuring in each case in respect of one of the obligations identified in the confirmation and the bankruptcy of the reference entity in the case of all but the last of these the parties can choose to implement a type of materiality threshold by agreeing a payment requirement or default requirement that has to be crossed before the credit event is deemed to have occurred the parties may consider the definitions menu to be in need of amendment or supplement in order to deal with the specific credit risk they wish to trade for example the bankruptcy credit event focuses on events that corporate obligors could experience and would require tailoring if the reference entity were to take some other legal form the definition of restructuring was one of the most controversial provisions in the drafting process that led to the definitions in the forerunner of the definitions isdas long form of confirmation restructuring was defined by reference to events that had the effect of making the terms of the relevant obligation materially less favourable from an economic credit or risk perspective this definition was generally considered to be too subjective and had given rise to a number of disputes the new definition now refers to more objective criteria such as a reduction in the amount of principal or premium a degree of subjectivity is however retained in that events that would otherwise fall within the definition of restructuring do not constitute a restructuring if they do not result directly or indirectly from deterioration in the creditworthiness or financial condition of the reference entity however the markets disquiet regarding restructuring was not quelled by these changes and this recently gave rise to isda publishing a restructuring supplement the supplement restricts the types of obligation to which restructuring can apply it clarifies issues that the definitions were not clear on and places certain additional parameters on the ways in which a transaction can settle following a restructuring credit event obligations apart from the bankruptcy of the reference entity the question of whether a credit event has occurred is determined by reference to obligations identified in the confirmation the definitions introduce a matrix system based on the choice of one obligation category and if appropriate one or more obligation characteristics the aim of this structure is to introduce flexibility into the documentation process the obligation categories are payment borrowed money reference obligations only bond loan or bond or loan it is possible to give a very wide definition of obligations by selecting payment on the other hand it is possible to specify that credit events are only relevant if they occur with reference to only one obligation the reference obligation choosing one or more obligation characteristics has the effect of restricting the field of obligations in relation to which a credit event may occur because an event will be relevant only if it occurs in relation to obligations of the chosen category and which have the chosen characteristics examples of obligation characteristics are specified currency not domestic currency not domestic law conditions to payment the fact that a credit event has occurred is not sufficient to trigger the payment of credit protection before that can occur certain conditions to payment must be satisfied the definitions set out three conditions involving the service of notice a credit event notice must be served in any transaction before the credit protection will become payable the parties may choose that a notice of publicly available information must be served to cite news sources that confirm the occurrence of a credit event finally if the transaction is to settle physically a notice of intended physical settlement must be served by the buyer term of a transaction a credit event notice must refer to a credit event that occurs during the term of the transaction the term begins on the effective date and ends on the scheduled termination date both of which are agreed by the parties in the confirmation however where the credit event is a failure to pay the credit event must be continuing at the end of any applicable grace period or three days whichever is the longer this requirement is intended to avoid a credit event being triggered by a technical default but it means that a default could have occurred on or before the scheduled termination date even though the grace period is still pending at that time the definitions provide that the parties have two options in these circumstances they may either postpone the end of the term of the transaction beyond the scheduled termination date to the end of the grace period at which point if the failure to pay is continuing a credit event notice may be served alternatively they may agree that the grace period must have expired before the scheduled termination date or no credit event notice may be served the latter is the fallback provision which applies unless the parties agree otherwise physical and cash settlement the parties agree at the outset whether cash settlement or physical settlement applies to the relevant credit derivative transaction these are different means of realising the protection bought by the buyer where a credit event actually occurs if cash settlement applies the payment to be made by the seller to the buyer may be an amount fixed in advance or more usually an amount to reflect the drop in value of the reference obligation as determined by way of a dealers poll in the case of a physical settlement the buyer will deliver to the seller certain types of obligations deliverable obligations against payment of a fixed amount usually the face value of those obligations the buyer realises its protection because it delivers to the seller assets that are worth less than their face value but obtains payment of full face value from the seller physical settlement is widely used in the market because it avoids having to determine the exact market value of the relevant obligation and in circumstances where a credit event has occurred it may be difficult to assess the drop in value of the reference obligation for the purpose of cash settlement on the other hand some buyers may prefer cash settlement because if the buyer has selected physical settlement and is unable to obtain suitable deliverable obligations to deliver due to for instance a squeeze of liquidity in the market the buyer may lose some or all of the protection it had under the credit derivative deliverable obligations deliverable obligations are defined as is the case for obligations by choosing one deliverable obligation category and any relevant deliverable obligation characteristic although they are defined in the same way obligations and deliverable obligations play different roles whereas obligations are what the parties refer to in order to assess whether a credit event has occurred deliverable obligations come into play only as a settlement tool and if the parties have specified that physical settlement applies the two do not need to be the same future developments isda is working on producing dispute resolution guidelines it is also preparing a users guide to the definitions a goal in the future is to expand the definitions to govern more types of credit derivatives assembling market consensus support for such developments has proved tricky as a result isda has recently introduced a new approach to the compilation of standard documents involving the inauguration of a small working party to make recommendations to the rest of the market this working party nicknamed the is formed of institutions representing constituencies on both sides of the atlantic and different parts of the market the agenda it has set itself includes review of other parts of the definitions including the bankruptcy repudiationmoratorium acceleration and default credit events language for zero coupon bonds and convertible bonds and a clarification of the successor definition with a view to producing further supplements or guidance as to what constitutes market standard on various issues developments expected to be implemented in the coming months will show whether the c approach is more efficient than the previous collegiate approachthe credit derivatives market will continue to mature and expand these developments will mean that refining the definitions is a continuing process that will inspire fierce debate the direction for derivatives fow october there are several ongoing have hindered the development of credit derivatives lack of a single body to oversee disputes and concerns about risk exposure transparency have all added to a reluctance by some financial services organisations to use them as a result the development of underlying technology supporting credit derivatives has progressed more slowly than in other banking industry areas but this looks likely to change one of the major reasons for this is that the use of credit derivatives is beginning to climb according to the bank of england the notional principal outstanding exceeds trillion globally and the british bankers association says the credit derivatives market has grown from an estimated billion outstanding notional value in to an estimated at the end of this increase is being driven by various developments in the banking industry not least the push for transparency other key factors include the need for banks to diversify their risk portfolio which is particularly important in a recession or slowdown to limit exposure to individual market sectors achieve straight throughprocessing to improve efficiency and cost savings demonstrate to regulators that they meet capital adequacy requirements ensure an integrated single view of investment and risk as our current economic situation worsens exposure to credit risk grows and the use of financial instruments such as credit derivatives is increasing this has coincided with growing pressure in recent years for financial institutions to automate and integrate all their applications and processes to meet regulatory requirements minimise risk and keep pace with technological innovation recent market developments although not widely used the advent of online credit derivatives trading exchanges such as creditexcom credittradecom and creditdimensionscom is a significant indication that the market is growing the exchanges are backed by major players creditex founded in april for example has equity investment and support from deutsche bank jp morgan chase and bank of america among others while creditdimensions eclectic mix includes algorithmics bureau van dijk electronic publishing and standard and poors prebon yamane and internet capital group are among the supporters of credittradecom and a new entrant eprimuscom is expected to join the fray later this year intending to act as a creator and investor by selling credit protection in the form of default swaps on more than investmentgrade names these online exchanges also highlight the need for integrated systems particularly as banks are notorious for the number and diversity of platforms and applications used integration interlude in the past financial organisations have relied on spreadsheets to record credit derivatives transactions and for most this is still the case yet as stp and risk management become even higher on the agenda so too does the push for technologies that can effectively automate and manage transactions banks must ensure that all processes are fully integrated and that back and middle offices can keep pace with front offices however given the plethora of proprietary trading platforms used by banks offerings must be easily designed built and integrated into core systems to be a worthwhile investment electronic initiation execution and settlement is essential it is therefore crucial that any credit derivatives solution is open scalable stable flexible easy to integrate futureproof software today so whats on the market so far some vendors are pushing endtoend solutions while others are focusing on packaged componentbased solutions which can be bolted on to core systems and other vendors say their solutions can be bought as a standalone module or as part of a suite leading players so far include front capital murex summit sungard and savvysoft the us companies appear to be benefiting from first mover advantage in the uk marketplace at this stage current suppliers tend to be global organisations with an hq in new york one exception is front capital systems which has an office in london as well as in new york stockholm frankfurt zurich and johannesburg many of the vendors are pushing fronttobackoffice solutions covering cash and derivatives trading as well as foreign exchange energy and commodities equities and interest rates front arena from front capital systems for example combines fixed income asset swap and interest rate derivative capabilities with credit derivative functionality with high yielding securities and credit derivatives in the same system monitoring all positions simultaneously becomes easier some vendors such as murex offer a suite of integrated front and back office systems sharing the same middle and back office platform the solution offers integrated fronttoback office software solutions for cash and derivatives trading and processing in fx energy and commodities equities and interest rates this includes listed overthe counter and exotics derivatives on securities and fx summits credit derivatives module can be run as a standalone application or as part of a product suite and supported instruments include credit swaps credit linked bonds risky bonds and forward bonds purchase features include default probabilities and recovery rates vendors including sungard and savvysoft have created componentbased offerings sungards credit derivatives components module provides a buildingblock asset allowing any possible credit derivative product to be structured and managed in a portfolio the module aims to offer staff the ability to structure price analyse trade and risk manage a variety of credit derivative instruments it supports several credit derivative instruments including credit default swaps credit spread options and total rate of return swaps the functionality includes the ability to touch payreceive par amount at the time a credit event occurs end payreceive par amount at the end of the contracts life if a credit event occurs annuity payreceive a fee from the time a credit event occurs until the maturity of the contract fee payreceive a fee from the start of the contract until the first of either a credit event occurring or contract maturity and risk management is not forgotten the solution emphasises the importance of analytical integrity and the ability to support enterprisewide risk management it includes risk measures for credit derivatives commensurate with other interestrate sensitive instruments such as bonds caps and swaps this means that risk can therefore be aggregated across asset classes andor on a portfolio or enterprisewide level there is also an option to produce specific credit derivatives reports savvysofts tops suite of products comprises nearly otc and exchangetraded derivatives models savvysofts newest product tops credit is geared to handling many types of credit derivatives including total rate of return swaps credit default swaps credit linked notes credit spread options and others like summit savvysoft takes default probabilities into account in addition to letting the user specify the probability of an issuer default tops credit can also base its calculations on the probability of counterparty default and the correlation between these two probabilities the probabilities include functions of time interest rate levels and stock price levels to give users control over credit derivatives valuations huge opportunity the credit risk transfer market has the potential to increase the overall robustness of the global financial system over time but to do this it is essential that financial institutions can rely on a stable scalable flexible solution that can be easily managed and integrated into core systems the growing popularity of credit derivatives will offer it vendors an opportunity to extend their reach within financial institutions but we are currently at the early stages the credit derivatives instrument is still in development and the market is wide open for technology vendors particularly uk based suppliers to enter this is an emerging market and we have a long way to go before we know who will be the leader in this space and how it will develop end of isda press report

may want to print it out and read a hard copy your suggestion of following the joint defense discussion of what theyll discuss with the court on september was a good one although i think the general direction of the joint defense group is sound it may be in epmis best interest to have counsel there even if it is local counsel so that we can avoid travel expenses at this point consistent with what the bankruptcy court has stated on the record and based upon more recent conversations with his former law clerk the judge would like to resolve at the hearing whether the parties are willing to go to mediation and whether there is agreement to appoint a special discovery master to handle the myriad of discovery disputes that have already arisen and that are certain to multiply as the cases move forward from listening to the defense counsel who have appeared before the judge in this case it is clear that this judge does not want to decide anything is loath to try these cases and promises to give only day a month for any trial let alone the trials that would be necessary to hear these cases if they dont settle the judge will not consider summary judgments and he is held in low regard by the defense group the big players on the joint defense team very much want the equivalent of a special discovery master but they want the powers defined more broadly so that the master can make recommendations to the judge of how to try these cases if they go to trial eg bifurcation of factual and legal issues to resolve before full trial on the merits order in which the cases will go to trial etc the recommendation of the rest of the joint defense group is to ask that a special pretrial master be appointed to resolve discovery disputes and make recommendations to the bankruptcy judge for further proceedings including trial each defendant would be able to go to mediation whenever it feels it has enough discovery but the majority of the defense group did not want to ask for the appointment of a settlement mediator at this time although there was not complete consensus the majority view was to propose that the costs of the special master be split evenly among all the parties there are approximately adversaries on file and counsel representing more than one defendant were already arguing that they should only be treated as only one party given how closely aligned their defenses and interests are further although most of the defense group feels that the trust should be required to pay its share as party many are willing to withdraw that requirement and let the trust get a free ride if the trustee objects to the proposal thereby isolating the trustee and making him look foolish i raise this in detail because of my concern that epmi with much cleaner and stronger defenses may end carrying more of the expense freight than it should given that everyone envisions that this pretrial mediator will have his or her hands full the expense of even of that could add up quickly my suggestion is that the plaintiff or particular defendant who files the discovery dispute pays for the time the pretrial master spends resolving it for matters involving all defendants then the costs be split evenly my further suggestion echoing what yall said on our last conference call is to try to position this case for settlement as soon as possible so that the expenses do not mount by virtue of the morass of the rest of the litigation against defendants who did not terminate their contracts the next issue is whether to attend the hearing on the the order setting the hearing was finally entered on september elizabeth austin recommended local counsel was kind enough to send me a copy the order requires that the hearing be attended by all counsel for all defendants in the pending adversary proceedings counsel are further required to have full authorization to resolve any issue arising at the status conference and shall be either accompanied by the person or persons authorized and competent to accept or reject the resolution of such issues or such persons shall be available by telephone further the docket reflects that a pretrial order is due in our case by september this is an special animal of the local rules and is not the typical pretrial order it only requires that parties states whether they agree that the case is a core or noncore proceeding set forth the answer or response date and set forth the proposed length for discovery the plaintiff is responsible for contacting the defendant to reach agreement on the pretrial order to date i assume that youve received no calls or correspondence from kaye scholer about this in another adversary filed against el paso about the same time that the case against enron was filed the trustee has already unilaterally filed a motion to extend the deadline for filing the pretrial ill check the docket again on monday to see if such an extension motion was filed in our adversary if we are contacted by the trustee counsel between now and the it will take all of about minutes to prepare the pretrial order again this is a long way of saying that although we are not obligated to do anything about the pretrial order especially since we havent yet received a copy of the complaint we do have actual knowledge of the proceedings we have joined the defense group and we may get off to a bad start if we dont attend the hearing and then try to argue that we dont want some part of the order entered to apply to us if i were the judge my first question would be why werent you here on the so that you could have objected then to respond that we didnt think we had to because we had not yet received a copy of the complaint in the mail may not endear us to the judge if he presses us to find out what we actually knew about the hearing my recommendation is that either local counsel or i attend the hearing even though id love to avoid the cost altogether there is a joint defense meeting the night before and the morning of the status hearing where the group is going to further attempt to reach agreement among themselves as to how theyre going to propose to handle discovery and legal issues assuming that a pretrial master is appointed if you decide that i dont need to go i would recommend that our local counsel attend if we have retained him or her by then if it is elizabeth austin i have confidence that she will adequately protect enrons interests especially given her prior involvement in the case if counsel for epmi attends the hearing then you elizabeth or jeff should be reachable by phone in case something comes up that we need authorization for we have another joint defense conference call set up for wednesday sept at pm by that time a draft of the proposed order for the pretrial master will be circulated with the proposed sharing of costs provisions if we are going to object to an equal sharing for all work performed by the pretrial master i should advise the group on wednesday in this call if we arent able to get this case settled relatively quickly there will be a great deal of benefit by being a member of the joint defense group especially with regard to establishing other grounds for termination of the transactions and fighting the trustees damage calculations in determining the appropriate settlement amount we should be cognizant that the costs of the defense may be higher than it would otherwise be if this were the only pending litigation involving this kind of claim i look forward to your response i will be in town all of next week so call at your convenience"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody", "pk": 1370, "fields": {"body_text": "kim please review and add anything you want and return c johnsean a few thoughts on the griffith deal term ppl

in florida is that the sitting process is very much intertwined with property rights and row acquisition ultimately relying on condemnation to get there in florida there is a process to establish that there was a public need that required government action at fpl we relied on the process to obtain an eventual outcome where there was the forceof law of the greater public good to be able to obtain the row this was crucial for the transmission row for all lines greater than kv many more individual owners and needed to complete the connection within the selected route the sitting process for the generation site was not as controversial because we acquired or held rights to sites which had been prescreened to avoid controversy but obviously a permit for a generation site is useless if you cant get the power into the grid thus you need the transmission row part of the process involved providing options and costs community involvement etc which ultimately resulted in a choice determined to have been prudently undertaken longer much costly line part underground etc in every case there were not in my backyard arguments at times disguised as an emf issue also in every case the authorities knew that they had to select one option or make one on their own not selecting one meant that there would be power shortages and they would have to answer to the people impacted the local voters under the regulatory framework where there will be concurrent filings for competing projects the determination of public need will be more difficult to acertain you may end up having an approval but not

"california needs deregulation done right by daniel mcfadden the wall street journal dow jones company inc the electricity market in california has swung over its history from monopolization by industrialists in its early days to comprehensive regulation then to partial deregulation in the and now back toward substantial regulation and government intervention in the past each swing of the pendulum came from public frustration with the way this market operated and each produced a result that the public again found unsatisfactory but the memory of politicians and the public is short the state is poised to repeat the mistakes of the last cycle of regulation measures passed by the california legislature this month are an illconceived intervention that will lock the state into high energy costs and put it at a competitive disadvantage for years to come unless there is further action the state will maintain subsidized retail prices that discourage conservation while capping instate wholesale prices in a manner that discourages construction of new instate generation capacity and leaves californians at the mercy of outofstate generators government subsidization of electricity consumption will drain tax revenues that might be better used for education and other needs encumber californias children with debt to pay the states energy bills and threaten the states future ability to sell bonds for public projects the immediate political cost of consumer outrage from higher electricity rates may be postponed but the real economic cost promises to be massive the sad thing is that this is all unnecessary the source of the crisis was rigid regulation of retail prices in the face of rapid increases in wholesale prices driven by increased fuel prices and increased demand in the national electricity market the only effective solution to the crisis is to make retail price regulation more flexible so that consumers see the real economic cost of electricity and respond to high prices through conservation efforts that reduce demand and push prices down on the supply side the state should encourage construction of new instate generation capacity through the right market signals giving producers the opportunity to site plants and sell power under conditions comparable to other states its true that state action was needed to stabilize the electricity market avoid immediate bankruptcy of the distribution companies and assure continued delivery of energy but this step will only postpone the day of reckoning unless sensible electricity pricing is introduced as well to limit the impact of high prices on the poor increasing blockrate tariffs can be used in which the rates for lifeline electricity use are kept low these were effective in limiting demand for water during californias last drought and are already used to promote energy conservation a more aggressive version that pushes the rates in highusage blocks to the real loadlinked economic cost of electricity would provide an incentive that would stimulate conservation at the precise points that will do the most to moderate demand and push down wholesale prices consumers should have the opportunity to hedge against price spikes and average their payments to ease the pain of price volatility the installation of loadsensitive meters should be accelerated so that consumers can respond to the economic price of the electricity they are consuming this is new technology for us utilities but has operated well in france for years on the supply side the state and the federal energy regulatory commission could use their regulatory power to require that existing generators redirect excess profits to finance lifeline rates for retail customers and work off the hangover from previous electricity purchased and not paid for however care should be taken in dealing with generators to assure that every kilowatt hour that any generation facility can produce at less than the national wholesale price of electricity is in fact delivered to the market the state needs to be very cautious about getting into the power business as an intermediary between generators and distributors government bureaucracies rarely show dexterity in dealing with private suppliers and access to general government revenues dulls their incentive to operate efficiently negotiating longterm contracts right now when california is in a weak market position and the outofstate generators are in the drivers seat is likely to put the state at a future competitive disadvantage consumers need to be reminded that money passed through the government to subsidize electricity comes out of their pockets just as surely as price increases without the mitigating benefits of demand reductionthe lessons of history suggest that in making the hobsons choice between a dysfunctional partially deregulated market and a fullyregulated one that promises to be even more dysfunctional california is picking the greater of the two evils if it fails to move to sensible electricity pricing in which both consumers and suppliers see the real economic price at the margin it will face another even more serious crisis in the not too distant future mr mcfadden a professor of economics at the university of california berkeley received the nobel prize in economics last year"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody", "pk": 1456, "fields": {"body_text": "please review and provide comments by tues thanks"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody", "pk": 1457, "fields":

notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow lft shippers would be able to flow that percentage and the rest could be scheduled it drew latched onto this when i mentioned it to him and

scheduled similarly if tw were to notify shippers of a partial limited day and of the capacity in fact became available tws system would allow lft shippers to put their nominations in and flow not limit them to tws tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this a limited day is defined as a day on which tw may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part and the billing section has

growing confusion over californias energy future state regulators yesterday ducked the politically volatile question of whether utilities such as pg can sock customers with billions of dollars in extra electricity charges the public utilities commission did approve a rate cap for san diego electricity customers but frustrated commissioners hinted they may kick the matter of who pays for utilities costs back to the state legislature which had been hoping the puc would solve the thorny question for his part gov gray davis suggested yesterday that the issue should stay with the puc everyone is passing the buck said mike boyd president of californians for renewable energy a sunnyvale nonprofit group the legislature doesnt want to touch it the puc doesnt want to touch it its a hot potato and the stakes are very high as the chronicle reported yesterday pacific gas and electric co hopes to hit its customers with all the costs it will accrue under a current rate freeze as much as billion when the utilitys rates are deregulated in early for its part san diego gas electric is estimating that its costs could run as high as million and it too wants ratepayers to shoulder the full burden boyd said california lawmakers and energy regulators ultimately may be forced to call on the federal energy regulatory commission to weigh in on the matter reluctance to play referee however the commissions chairman james hoecker said in a telephone interview from washington dc that federal authorities would be reluctant to play referee the recovery of costs could arguably be an issue for us he said but were not in the habit of telling states what their laws mean thats something state officials themselves are still grappling with amid confusion over whether they even have jurisdiction over such an issue the puc commissioners said their approval of the rate cap in san diego is unrelated to whether utilities should be compensated for outofpocket expenses the rate cap as mandated in a bill passed by lawmakers last week required the blessing of the commission to take effect law fuzzy on compensation the governor signed the bill into law on wednesday however the law is fuzzy about whether the local utility should be compensated for expenses incurred as a result of the rate cap at issue is the difference between what utilities must pay for power in the turbulent wholesale energy market and the amount they can charge ratepayers californias electricity deregulation bill froze power rates statewide to stabilize the industry during a transition to a free market arena san diego was the first city to face the full impact of deregulation when its rate freeze was lifted last year average power bills subsequently doubled sparking outrage and protests among ratepayers the governor has accused power generators of manipulating prices and gouging consumers state and federal authorities are investigating such charges by imposing a rate cap yesterday the puc effectively brought electricity deregulation to a halt as lawmakers and regulators struggle to fix the current system regulation is coming back because it has to said nettie hoge executive director of the utility reform network a san francisco consumer group rate cap retroactive in line with the new law the puc capped san diego power rates for residential customers and small businesses at cents per kilowatt hour retroactive to june this means average monthly power bills will be about the commission also opened an investigation into the prudence and reasonableness of san diego gas electrics decision not to secure longterm wholesale energy contracts instead the utility exposed its customers to daily swings in energy prices our basic obligation is to assure the people of california that the rates they pay for energy are just and fair said puc commissioner carl wood however he stressed that yesterdays puc action did not address the question of whether utilities should be compensated for deregulationrelated expenses and said the matter should be taken up at a later date we are acting too much in haste agreed richard bilas a republican appointee who seldom sees eyetoeye with democratic appointee wood on puc decisions the most the commission should do is make a recommendation to the legislature bilas said for his part the governor yesterday moderated the aggressively proconsumer stance he has taken in response to the states energy woes asked whether utilities should be able to place a surcharge on future bills to recover costs related to deregulation davis adopted a more conciliatory tone i do believe utilities should not be left holding the bag for any problems associated with the law if they have acted responsibly he said pg officials told the chronicle on wednesday that the utility is now about billion in the hole as a result of its rate freeze and that this amount is rising by nearly million a month sen dede alpert dsan diego one of the authors of the ratecap legislation said that while the question of who should tackle the surcharge issue remains up in the air a likely outcome is that both the utilities and ratepayers will end up shouldering some costs in

pride themselves on a broad reach across dozens of industries they claim that gives you more opportunities to profit but thats just baloney theres no way one individual or even a substantial team can spread himself that thin and still do quality researchespecially when it comes to the complex world of high tech thats why my team and i do one thing and one thing only we target the hottest growth markets of technology from microchips to software to biotech and we reap the profits most investors miss did you own immunex for example im sure by now youve heard of amgens buyout of this fastgrowing biotech firm when that deal was announced yesterday it included a premium for our immunex stock but our profits locked in after i advised clients to sell in an urgent email bulletin were much higher than that we banked gains in just months time i hope you owned immunex but if you didnt dont worry about it in just a moment ill tell you all about my current pick another overlooked stock that should double your money at least in then multiply it times over by but first an important lesson to be learned from immunex dont believe everything you hear on wall street back when we bought immunex traders were down on almost everything related to the drug industry and i agreed with them to a point you see the big drug companies are facing intense pressure from generic drugmakers mercks big disappointment is a perfect example earnings growth next year thats pitiful in todays drug hungry world but as the baby boomers pass into their golden years drugs are still a huge play just not in the traditional way most big pharma companies like merck pfizer and j have really slipped when it comes to new drug development but innovative biotechs like immunex are a totally different story their r is redhot so when wall street tarred the traditional firms and biotechs with the same brushwe stepped in to pick immunex up for a song eight months later were richer now were about to pull off another profit coup just like it but with much bigger potential and this time around you have the opportunity to join us heres the truth about todays socalled communications fiber glut that everyone keeps talking about when the world trade center got hit the internet slowed down very noticeably slowed down in fact it nearly came to a grinding halt that means there isnt nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip in demand sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem after all this is the second time its happened back in july a tunnel fire in baltimore slowed the internet to a crawl for two full days that means our communications systems and therefore our economy are very very vulnerable ten years ago it wouldnt have mattered but today commerce and security is completely dependent on those systems virtually nothing moves without it thats how banks and brokerages transfer fundshow dispatchers route fleets of truckshow many americans get paid through direct deposit and we are closer to the breaking point than of americans even begin to understand heres one example qwest one of americas biggest carriers recently said theyre loaded on their network that doesnt sound too baduntil you understand how these networks operate you cant load a network much past in fact is virtually catastrophic because the network spends so much time searching for open channels it doesnt spend any time actually sending packets of information the system locks communications stops the nation comes to a standstill america is falling behind the rest of the developed world internet traffic systems currently run faster in australia europe and even south america thats because we push out more data than everyone else but were not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate weve got to catch up and weve got to catch up fast otherwise business the economy and our national security all go in the crapper but why do we have this capacity problem amidst a fiber glut because of all the fiber that has ever been laid is dark that is its not activated and the company im recommending is the supplier of the components needed to do the job im looking at a double possibly a triple by this time next year and i fully expect to multiply our money fivetimes over by in fact this stock truly has tenbagger potential at the height of the boom this companys stock was nearly times higher so what changed spending on communications networks dried up now the government is ready to pump billion in emergency spending into the economy interest rates are practically zero and the need isnt just vital for the economy anymore its a question of national security please dont miss out youll kick yourself bigtime

without gaining pounds you cant pick up a magazine without finding a list of holiday eating dos and donts eliminate second helpings highcalorie sauces and cookies made with butter they say fill up on vegetable sticks they say good grief is your favorite childhood memory of christmas a carrot stick i didnt think so isnt mine either a carrot was something you left for rudolph i have my own list of tips for holiday eating i assure you if you follow them youll be fat and happy so what if you dont make it to new years your pants wont fit anymore anyway about those carrot sticks avoid them anyone who puts carrots on a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the christmas spirit in fact if you see carrots leave immediately go next door where theyre serving rum balls drink as much eggnog as you can and quickly like fine singlemalt scotch its rare in fact its even rarer than singlemalt scotch you cant find it any other time of year but now so drink up who cares that it has calories in every sip its not as if youre going to turn into an egg nogaholic or something its a treat enjoy it have one for me have two its later than you think its christmas if something comes with gravy use it thats the whole point of gravy pour it on make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes fill it with gravy eat the volcano repeat as for mashed potatoes always ask if theyre made with skim milk or whole milk if its skim pass why bother its like buying a sports car with an automatic transmission do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control your eating the whole point of going to a christmas party is to eat other peoples food for free lots of it hello remember college under no circumstances should you exercise between now and new years you can do that in january when you have nothing else to do this is the time for long naps which youll need after circling the buffet table while carrying a pound plate of food and that vat of eggnog if you come across something really good at a buffet table like frosted christmas cookies in the shape and size of santa position yourself near them and dont budge have as many as you can before becoming the center of attention theyre like a beautiful pair of shoes you cant leave them behind youre not going to see them again same for pies apple pumpkin mincemeat have a slice of each or if you dont like mincemeat have two apples and one pumpkin always have three when else do you get to have more than one dessert labor day did someone mention fruitcake granted its loaded with the mandatory celebratory calories but avoid it at all cost

says the generator is refusing to make public some information crucial to the pricegouging probe firm says its complying carl ingram times staff writer july sacramento the chairman of a senate committee probing suspected price gouging during the california energy crisis charged monday that duke energy is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation sen joe dunn said duke has made the price bidding information from its chula vista plant available to committee members and staffers but under a federal confidentiality rule the data cannot be made public without dukes consent the documents concern the chula vista plant which former employees have alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in january however state records show that the agency overseeing the electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout the state dunn said dukes refusal thwarts the committees investigation and efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with others in the legislature or the public dunn said duke cited a rule of the federal energy regulatory commission that gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and which stay secret the only one who can release the data is duke we agreed to be bound by what is provided in the ferc tariff nothing more or less he said former employees tell of maneuvers dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information elsewhere and release it over dukes objections three former workers at the duke plant near chula vista testified last month under oath that the plant among other things was ramped up and down in what seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the jan emergency but duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the california independent system operator which keeps the states electricity grid in balance duke later provided caliso documents backing up its explanation duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full picture of the plants operation during the three days but dunn chairman of the select senate committee on alleged price gouging said monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data duke was guilty of the same tactics duke is trying to draw the impression that it has the full picture but they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released that hasnt occurred dunn said to make a determination whether the chula vista power was withheld to drive up prices dunn said the committee must publicly examine the bids duke submitted from which the iso issued orders to the plant they include the expensive hourahead and dayahead markets he said duke a north carolinabased wholesaler that operates several plants in california noted that it considers the information proprietary and offlimits to legislators not on the committee duke spokesman tom williams insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committees demands but he was unable to say whether duke would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn over we are complying now williams said there is some suggestion that we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify i dont know what we are ultimately going to do the committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidding documents by wednesday six including duke have said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation two enron and mirant were cited dunn said the committee on wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to comply an extra week to do so but others probably will be formally charged with contempt in a report to the full senate the upper house is the final arbiter of such issues although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited for contempt dunn said he favors imposing severe fines in the most recent case a cement company executive was sent to jail copyright los angeles times sue mara

summary davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for past utility debt davis and pg negotiations at a standstill sticking point is net short for pg this summer as the days go on with no word of a secured deal involuntary bankruptcy chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions for california california public utility commission rate increases today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the department of water resources rate increase to be passed along to consumers on their electricity bills until now davis has considered rate hikes to be political suicide but there may be some relief for him from consumer groups sources indicate that one of californias main consumer advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt dwr which is currently buying power on behalf of the state needs more income to securitize the planned bond issue that is key part of davis plan to sign long term power contracts as dwr continues to spend to m every day on power purchases a well placed source informed us the dwr is essentially bankrupt it currently has no money for normal activities such as ordering supplies purchasing new equipment etc the department of finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can parks other programs to purchase power but dwrs hands are tied until revenue bonds are issued the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover billion worth of state bonds davis pg at odds sources report that davis and pg negotiations are facing two difficult challenges pg wants times book which is far more than consumer groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines and pg needs relief from davis for pg legal responsibility to be the ultimate power purchaser for the state and at this point davis wants to limit further state energy power purchases the utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars further in the red and pg may declare bankruptcy for their utility subsidiary if davis tries to force the issue additionally davis is being hounded by the press and harvey rosenfield to publish details of the states longterm power contracts a measure that if accomplished would provide davis with even less negotiating power with all this activity davis is starting to lose support in the state legislature sources report increasing tension between the governor and state senate president protem john burton burton has just announced a special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of price manipulation and the state auditor is also planning an investigation davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later qfs most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience and force bankruptcy on the utilities sb may have been californias qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing against pg socal ed and sdg the bill designed to cut the qfs costs and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the states senate sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates out with hebert in with wood the bush administration favors replacing hebert jr with texas puc head pat wood there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican leader trent lott who favors hebert and president bush who wants wood the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states in in effort to tone down the recent press reports hebert has made several token concessions to california including million worth of power refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and power plant installation its is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal that davis could complete but with a list of conditions some conditions might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in the west next year the bush administration is opposed to price caps and believes in

entity this means coming up with an answer very quickly there are a number of potential alternatives and i am sure there are more than i will attempt to lay out here we could simply make a contribution to eott for the sole purpose of environmental cleanup and if unused will be returned seems like an expense item but doable we could provide an insurance policy to eott to provide for environmental expenses in excess of the existing policy for a fee better expense treatment and appears to cover the eott issue because this is an affiliated deal i guess it would have to go through the audit committee potentially the captive could be used provide an accounting answer that might give eott a onetime gain to offset the one time reserve setup ie there is a least an argument that the recapitalization proposed will result in the extinguishment of a portion of the debt on the books represented by the apis since we are getting a conversion of less than a dollar for dollar deal this should be doable for lawrence jim bouillion has indicated that the insurance proposal may have merit and so i will need some input from you regarding the coverage that exists now and what we would want going forward if you want us to talk directly with susan we will i am thinking that you are getting a quote for increasing the cap on the existing policy and that we could give you the same deal

meet or beat consensus earnings estimates kmi reported great news with a boost in second quarter earnings over the same period a year ago and yeartodate earnings up however kmis general limited partner kinder morgan energy partners lp almost trumped the broadcast with its announcement that it would buy a mile texas natural gas pipeline system for million and split its stock two for one kmis net income for the quarter was million or per diluted common share compared with million or for the same period of during a conference call with investors ceo richard kinder said earnings were driven by its pipeline partner kmp whose earnings more than doubled compared to the second quarter a year ago adding that would be hard to imagine we could have had a much better quarter calling kmp the real driver of the real growth kinder said that while no company can escape economic downturn kmi is about as minimally exposed as possible kinder who said the company is still on track to make additional acquisitions or growth plans before the end of the year also hinted that another pipeline expansion announcement could be forthcoming kmp he said is in discussions about a major expansion in the rockies although the west coast is on most companies radar screens for pipe growth kinder said he thought that a possible pipeline expansion should go east but were just talking calling production thus far in the rocky mountain basin a great story kinder said the company had major advantages and it looks pretty good so far he did not detail when any announcements may be made kmps newest pipeline deal with an affiliate of occidental petroleum corp includes pipe that primarily transports gas from south texas and the texas gulf coast region to the greater houstonbeaumont area a very good growth market kinder said the assets are currently leased and operated by kmp as a major part of the kinder morgan texas pipeline business unit kmp also signed a fiveyear agreement to supply almost bcf of natural gas to chemical facilities owned by occidental affiliates in the houston area with kmps earnings tied into kmis kinder said that as the operator we are very familiar with the assets involved in this transaction and their excellent growth potential the transaction expected to close in the third quarter is expected to be immediately accretive to perunit distributions by about annually under the lease terms kmp will pay million annually from through and million annually through on track to deliver more than a increase in earnings per share this year kinder pointed to kmis premier feebased portfolio of midstream assets adding that kmi was comfortable with current consensus earnings estimates of per share but said kmi would raise its estimate to between and per share breaking down its earnings by business segment kinder said kmi will receive million in total cash distributions from kmp for the second quarter of up from million a year ago as kmps cash flow grows kmis general partner share of that cash flow grows dramatically he said kmis cash flow from kmp increased significantly due to internal growth in kmps pipeline and terminal segments and the strong performance of recent kmp acquisitions after equity accounting and amortization kmp contributed million of pretax earnings to kmi in the second quarter up from million a year ago the product pipelines segment delivered a increase in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization of million in the second quarter compared to million during the same period a year ago the natural gas pipelines segment produced segment earnings before dd of million a increase which reflected strong earnings growth from red cedar gathering company and the inclusion of additional gas assets that were transferred from kmi to kmp at the end of adding kinder morgan texas pipeline to this segment has made our gas pipeline business more seasonal shifting more of the segments income to the first and fourth quarters kinder explained for this reason the yeartodate increase of in segment earnings before dd is more representative than a second quarter comparison natural gas pipeline company of america a kmi subsidiary earned million in the quarter up from million in the second quarter of ngpl benefited said kinder from its successful recontracting of its longhaul transportation and storage capacity adding that the subsidiary expects to add approximately mw of gasfired capacity annually through which should boost demand power earnings surged recording million compared with million for the second quarter of a jump which the company attributed to growth in feeincome associated with gasfired power plant development two mw plants expected to come online in the second quarter of are under construction in little rock ar and jackson mi both of those are on schedule and on budget kinder said retail was the only segment that was down but kinder offered a positive spin on this as well with earnings down million from a year earlier he noted that earnings in the second quarter of were boosted because of an earlier than normal highdemand irrigation season however its precisely that type of volatility that led us to initiate a weather hedging program in late to normalize our summerirrigation and winterheating load with our hedging now in place retail earnings are up yeartodate and we remain confident that retail will deliver approximately growth in segment earnings this year by itself kmp the largest pipeline master limited partnership in the united states had a record quarter with every business segment producing increased cash flow and earnings our results reflect both excellent internal growth and outstanding performance by recently acquired pipeline and terminal assets said kinder kmp declared a second quarter distribution of per unit that will be payable aug to unitholders of record as of july the distribution is higher than the distribution of per unit paid for the second quarter of the two for one stock split will be distributed on aug to holders of record on aug this is the second time that kmp has split the units since its formation in february kinder

opec limits the cartel is expected to finalize an agreement to cut million bpd from output along with almost bpd of reductions from nonopec producers at the meeting the cartels overall compliance with its selfimposed limits improved in november as the members were bpd over their limits however according to its own data nigeria pumped bpd in excess of its quota making it responsible for half the cheating if opec cuts output by an expected million bpd nigerias new quota would be about million bpd necessitating a bpd cut or from its november volumes nigerias presidential adviser on energy will takeover as opec president on january making it even more important that it adhere to the quota some cartel members say that full compliance will be stressed at the meeting because they have asked nonmembers to make commitments and it is important for opec to stick to set an example it is unlikely that opec members will reach full compliance during january sales commitments for the month have already been made and although some members like saudi arabia have flexibility in their contracts others would need to reduce volumes already sold energy energy feas complete suite of energy products

phone fax russias oil export plan leaves loopholes russias quarter oil export schedule makes it only appear that the country will keep a promise to cut bpd of exports in a bid to help opec lift sagging crude prices this week it set an export schedule to export million tonnes of its own crude and will ship million tonnes of kazakh and tonnes of azeri crude in the quarter of next year although the schedule looks like a firm pledge to reduce exports there is no benchmark figure to which the schedule could be compared russian traders say that the countrys oil firms will seek ways to increase crude exports to the west because it pays more than domestic consumers they point out that while the export schedule includes only volumes moved by the state pipeline transneft over million tonnes per quarter bypass transneft there are many ways to increase officially declared quarter volumes for example by allowing oil companies to export cargoes not shipped in november and december due to storms it is also possible that russian oil companies will increase oil volumes to ukraine and belarus refineries where their further shipments will be hard to track energy sponsor become the official sponsor of the enerfax publications this unique opportunity is limited to one special company or organization for more information please write opec expected to announce production cut today opec is expected to officially announce its plan to cut up to million bpd from exports at a meeting in cairo today the output cut is expected to be effective as of january and last months and is aimed at lifting prices back into the range for opecs basket of crudes but some members of the cartel appear to be bowing to the realization that the global economy has weakened by saying that they believe to is a reasonable level and that is not a reasonable price the demand for oil is growing at its slowest pace since forcing opec and nonaligned producers to cut supplies the iea predicts that oil demand will grow by just bpd which is lower than the average growth over the last decade however many think that opec will fail because of the cartels poor record of compliance to previously instituted reductions opec members exceeded their quotas by bpd in november if opec does not stick to its selfimposed limits there is very little incentive for producers outside the cartel to abide by their commitments some expect that actual output reductions from opec and nonmembers will be closer to between million and million bpd which would be just about enough to keep stockpiles from rising

getting yards for the second straight saturday he also scored two touchdowns and caught three passes for yards benson had the days biggest offensive play it came with the longhorns leading and facing secondand at their own just before the the half the horns were going into a stout wind and colorado was threatening to get the ball back in great field position but simms dropped back and just before he was hit flipped a shovel pass to benson who caught it put an awesome move on two buff defenders and sped yards to launch the longhorns on an yard scoring drive that broke the game open the ut defense forced four buffalo turnovers three fumbles and a pass interception and held the potent colorado offense to just two first downs and net offensive yards in the second half the three fumbles colorado lost all came in the first half and cost the buffs a firstandgoal at the ut with texas ahead only and set up short longhorn scoring drives for the field goal that made it and the touchdown that gave texas a lead colorados starting qb craig ochs did not play because of a concussion he suffered in the victory over texas a last week his replacement bobby pesavento is a better passer but ochs is a much better runner and his absence caused the buffaloes to change their offensive strategy to include more passing and less double tight end power running the longhorn defense also had something to do with that here briefly is how the game went first quarter texas won the toss and deferred colorado took the ball and the longhorn defense stuffed the buffs power running game and forced a quick punt starting at their own after a short punt into the stiff wind the horns scored quickly benson ran for then simms hit te bo scaife for a wide receiver reverse was beautifully blocked

from three horns and bulled to the four before fumbling freshman lb derrick johnson recovered for texas the horns couldnt move and a short punt gave the buffs the ball at their own colorado went to its power running game and rolled to a first down at the ut before the longhorn defense stiffened and forced a yard field goal try that was wide cu led in first downs and in total offense but the longhorns led because they scored on their only foray deep into buff territory while the buffaloes fumble at the and missed chipshot fg killed both their scoring chances second quarter de kalen thornton forced a fumble that was recovered by ut cb roderick babers at the cu the horns drove to the before mangum kicked a yard field goal for a lead with left uts kickoff into the wind went out of bounds giving colorado good field position at the and the buffs got their running game going and swept in for the td in just seven plays to cut the lead to with left ut drove into buff territory but simms was sacked to kill the threat the third colorado fumble of the half set the horns up at the buff and they capitalized but they they had to score two tds to get credit for one first simms hit williams in the end zone and williams got a foot down in bounds but the official waved it off benson got the td on a yard run and mangums kick gave ut a lead with left a quick defensive stop gave the horns another possession at their with left simms was sacked at the on the first play but benson took a shovel pass juked two defenders off their feet at about the and scampered yards down the

drove yards in plays for another td with the payoff coming on a yard pass from simms to wr sloan thomas mangums kick gave texas a lead with left the ut defense stifled colorados next effort and nathan vasher ran the buffalo punt back yards to the cu setting up a yard mangum fg for a lead with left texas led in first downs and in total offense in the quarter fourth quarter simms found thomas all

game ends number updated daily i update my number every day with football and football recruiting news the number is it costs a minute you must be or older to call coachs corner coach mack brown said sunday studying the films of the longhorns victory over colorado saturday proved what we felt all along our guys played really well and really hard all day he also said colorado is a much better team than yesterdays score would indicate that was just a game that got out of hand because of turnovers he said he was very pleased with the shovel passes wide receiver reverses and other misdirection plays the horns used very successfully saturday if you are moving the ball they usually work he said weve talked about needing a little more misdirection all of them are things we need to run because it makes our regular plays work better he had said last week wanted to use more traps run more gaps and counter gaps saying it slowed defensive pursuit and created more doubt in the minds of defenders after using a lot of them against the buffaloes he said they will remain a part of the ut offense colorado came into the game on a fivegame winning streak and with a powerful running game that ranked no nationally at yards a game and a strong rushing defense that was no nationally allowing only yards that had allowed the buffs to dominate time of possession against their foes they were averaging about minutes a game compared to about minutes for their opponents but texas dominated the time of possession to held the buffaloes to net rushing yards yards below their average and rushed on the buff defenders for yards about more than they had been allowing brown said the longhorn defense did an outstanding job against the cu power runners and he said the texas offense was successful because it was able to stay two dimensional but he said the early ut lead helped along by the colorado turnovers forced them to try to play catchup and playing catchup is not their game i think colorado is really good he said weve played so well at home and our crowd gives us a big advantage at home i think colorado will win a bunch more football games this year longhorn true freshman rb cedric benson picked up yards rushing on carries and scored two touchdowns in his second start it marked the first time all season a running back has hit the colorado defense for yards thats a credit to our balance our offensive line and to cedric brown said hes a fine running back who has great vision and who almost always falls forward hes getting better every week brown said he and his assistant coaches talk constantly to their players about the need to show up ready to play every week and he also said its way too early to worry about the bcs bowl situation because there are a lot of football games still to be played before that comes into play we talked to our team after florida lost to auburn about how you cant control anything except what you do anybody can beat anybody our guys understand the only thing they can do is be the best football team they can be and be ready to play missouri this saturday what weve got to do is try to win four more football games and see where that takes us longhorn notes quotes they say football is a game of inches and ut qb chris simms will buy into that particularly after executiing the shovel pass to freshman rb cedric benson just before the half that went for yards and helped break the game open i was nervous dropping back simms said i was in the end zone and saw the defensive end coming and i didnt know if our tackle got a good piece of him and im thinking gosh i have to get it out cedrics still turning around and i kind of threw it just as i was about to get hit and hoped he could catch it cedric just got turned around and he caught it and then made an unbelievable move down the sideline as for benson he says college football is a little more complicated than he thought it would be in high school it was basically run left run right he said here im learning how to block how to fake better and how to run better routes simms said benson is going to be great he runs so hard on every play and the thing i like about him is every time i drop back to pass and he protects for me he turns around after his block and goes did i do okay i say i didnt get hit did i you did okay"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody", "pk": 1866, "fields":

additional surgery may be necessary in july i met with mary kay manning ebs hr representative and inquired what my options would be regarding my injury if i should become part of the redeployment effort within ebs i was advised that the company was interested in seeing me healthy and i should take care of myself i was told that if i could get a letter from my doctor on that same day stating that i needed to be off from work that i would be eligible for short term disability and that my redeployment would begin upon my return the next day my formal redeployment was communicated to me by marla barnard vp of ebs hr i was informed that the offer extended to me the day before by mary kay was not an option at all and the start date of my redeployment would be unaffected by my injury at this point i felt this was my problem and that i would have to deal with it on my own approximately two weeks later i received a call from pam wilson ebs hr representative requesting a meeting in this meeting it was communicated to me that i had a couple of different options to think about to take off for rehabilitation one being that i could take months of unpaid leave to rehabilitate my injury and the other option being that i could use my accrued vacation time to rehabilitate i was advised that upon my return from either of those options that my redeployment period would begin at that time pam also mentioned the letter from my doctor which at this point i had not received on tuesday july i sent an email to pam advising her that i would like to take weeks of my vacation for rehabilitation later on in the day at a pm meeting with pam pam informed me that after meeting with legal that neither of these options were available and that my redeployment period would begin on august i know our hr people mean well and are trained to handle all types of situations however these are the facts presented to me and i would think that in a situation as serious as this is that anything out of the ordinary was researched and agreed upon before relaying any information to an employee i am a year employee with enron who before this injury had never taken short or longterm disability as well as no maternity leave and have had no issues regarding my offduty time my most recent performance ranking in my peer group was a one having said all of this i acknowledge that these are challenging times for certain parts of the compamy and fully realize that many necessary and sometimes painful business decisions are having to be made i would agree that there are times that corporations cannot act in ways that are totally fair i also feel on the other hand there are exceptions to be made regarding unique situations i am prepared to furnish as much documentation that is available from my doctor regarding the exact status of this injury i would like to be allowed to take time off for rehabilitiation in hopes of having the end result that a second surgery will not be necessary upon my return if business conditions continue to require my redeployment then i am fully accepting of that situation i will readily begin my redeployment period at that point and be subject to the same day conditions that now apply enron is a great company and i would love to stay employed here if that is not the case i hope that when i begin my job search elsewhere i will be able to move forward with complete recovery from this injury thank you bobbie power"}}, {"model": "bend.emailbody", "pk": 1912, "fields": {"body_text": "at the iep meeting yesterday we heard that the governor

date on a couple of items boliviarandy asked if we have ever done any research on whether we could do derivatives in bolivia i told him i thought we had checked on this and determined that bolivia was not one of the countries that had been surveyed but that i would check with you to be sure i think he is asking since we are looking at doing physical deals there and the next thing the business guys always want to do is financial trades colombiathere is a new group of commercial guys who want to do electricity trading in colombia i have passed this request on to mark who is looking at it i think we will run into the same problems we had last year with the gas trading proposal susan baily found the colombia financial and physical trading survey for me to give to mark and i faxed some other memos i found in my files here there is a lot of memos on structures that had to do with the earlier trading vehicles and joint ventures which i did not send i also did not send the memos relating to our efforts to get financial trading allowed bob carter worked a lot on that issue but the commercial interest died before we saw any tangible results with the colombia political process brazildon lobbed a bomb last week to randy and then casually mentioned it to me after the fact don asked randy to set up a swap vehicle in brazil so that don can do his financial trading with argentina from brazil this is some speculation on my part but i think don doesnt like the current structure of having to run his financial trades with argentine counterparties through houston he does not have the ability to direct and control the process of negotiating and trading for argentina through ena which is problematic for him since for tax reasons we are telling him anything of substance has to come from ena in houston don asked randy who asked andrea bertone to set up a swap vehicle in brazil to trade with argentine counterparties obviously don could control the negotiating and trading from brazil and his operational problem is solved as you know this may create a whole host of other problems that cannot be solved as easily i will discuss with andrea today my initial thoughts on the issues raised by this proposal first the tax issues may make brazil a difficult place to make any money on a trading operation tax will need to be brought in first thing to analyse the structure second we may not be able to trade cross border swaps without regulatory problems we will need to speak with antonio felix and others at tozzini to start reviewing the structure third there may be significant currency issues involved that need to be reviewed at the same time we look at the tax and regulatory issues if we are able to overcome these issues then we will need to review the substantial legal and operational issues raised by such a structure the isda agreement which would be in english would need to be reviewed by local counsel to ensure that all of the substantive provisions including arbitration limitation of liability and collateral structures would be enforceable in brazil when entered into with argentine counterparties operational issues such as who will be responsible for the negotiation of masters drafting of confirmations etc would also need to be addressed argentinai think the acindar swap issue has gone away pat emailed though that they are now looking at an option structure i do not know what they mean by option or what the new structure would be i will let you know what i find out call when you get back and i can update you on where things

certain funnels it has been explicit practice to funnel certain types of transactions through central desks this is a good control mechanism even if it is a bit cumbersome my preference is to put pressure on the central desk to provide execution services structuring advice and operational help rather than building ones own as it relates to the credit effort it appears doubly important due to sfa considerations once again i have a strong preference that we tread nowhere near the line and use the procedures established by gary hickersons group to avoid any confusion and avoid an opportunity

verification that the contract was signed on or before enron and the other esps previously agreed with this approach i believe diann submitted the account information as we had agreed on nov i take a little bit of issue with the comment that they will reject dasrs for accounts not on the nov list until the contract is verified but i believe it follows the general spirit of what we agreed to at the meeting with esps and utilities on oct i think mr heckman thought he was being told that he could not add new facilities but thats not how i read the reply from mr lee so i called peter ouberg back

projections due to weakened demand in its targeted regional markets the express notes were issued in february to finance the construction of the express pipeline and to repay the costs incurred in the acquisition and upgrading of the platte pipeline the ability of express to service its debt is largely dependent upon the revenues received from the pipeline transportation tariffs paid by various crude shippers under contractual offtake arrangements express is a wholly owned subsidiary of alberta energy the express pipeline system consists of two main segments the express and platte pipelines the express segment is miles long beginning in hardisty alberta and running to casper wy the platte segment is miles long beginning in casper and extending to wood river il energy job listings whether

meeting today in cairo nigeria will likely receive intense pressure to increase compliance with its official opec limits the cartel is expected to finalize an agreement to cut million bpd from output along with almost bpd of reductions from nonopec producers at the meeting the cartels overall compliance with its selfimposed limits improved in november as the members were bpd over their limits however according to its own data nigeria pumped bpd in excess of its quota making it responsible for half the cheating if opec cuts output by an expected million bpd nigerias new quota would be about million bpd necessitating a bpd cut or from its november volumes nigerias presidential adviser on energy will takeover as opec president on january making it even more important that it adhere to the quota some cartel members say that full compliance will be stressed at the meeting because they have asked nonmembers to make commitments and it is important for opec to stick to set an example it is unlikely that opec members will reach full compliance during january sales commitments for the month have already been made and although some members like saudi arabia have flexibility in their contracts others would need to reduce volumes already sold energy energy feas complete suite of energy products built for the future manage all your energy risks build and price deals value physical

schedule makes it only appear that the country will keep a promise to cut bpd of exports in a bid to help opec lift sagging crude prices this week it set an export schedule to export million tonnes of its own crude and will ship million tonnes of kazakh and tonnes of azeri crude in the quarter of next year although the schedule looks like a firm pledge to reduce exports there is no benchmark figure to which the schedule could be compared russian traders say that the countrys oil firms will seek ways to increase crude exports to the west because it pays more than domestic consumers they point out that while the export schedule includes only volumes moved by the state pipeline transneft over million tonnes per quarter bypass transneft there are many ways to increase officially declared quarter volumes for example by allowing oil companies to export cargoes not shipped in november and december due to storms it is also possible that russian oil companies will increase oil volumes to ukraine and belarus refineries where their further shipments will be hard to track energy sponsor become the official sponsor of the enerfax publications this unique opportunity is limited to one special company or organization for more information please write opec expected to announce production cut today opec is expected to officially announce its plan to cut up to million bpd from exports at a meeting in cairo today the output cut is expected to be effective as of january and last months and is aimed at lifting prices back into the range for opecs basket of crudes but some members of the cartel appear to be bowing to the realization that the global economy has weakened by saying that they believe to is a reasonable level and that is not a reasonable price the demand for oil is growing at its slowest pace since forcing opec and nonaligned producers to cut supplies the iea predicts that oil demand will grow by just bpd which is lower than the average growth over the last decade however many think that opec will fail because of the cartels poor record of compliance to previously instituted reductions opec members exceeded their quotas by bpd in november if opec does not stick to its selfimposed limits there is very little incentive for producers outside the cartel to abide by their commitments some expect that actual output reductions from opec and nonmembers will be closer to between million and million bpd which would be just about enough to keep stockpiles from rising washington dc january spencer abraham us secretary of energy to address energy community on
